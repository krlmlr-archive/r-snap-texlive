<h2>Welcome to TeX Live</h2>

<p>The <strong>TeX Live</strong> software distribution offers a complete
TeX system for a variety of GNU and Unix, Macintosh, Windows and other
platforms. It encompasses programs for editing, typesetting, previewing
and printing of TeX documents in many different languages, and a large
collection of TeX macros and font libraries.

<p>The distribution includes extensive general documentation about TeX,
as well as the documentation for the included software packages.

<p>For licensing information, please see the top-level <a
href="../LICENSE.TL">LICENSE.TL</a> and <a
href="../LICENSE.CTAN">LICENSE.CTAN</a> text files.

<h3>Where to start</h3>

<p>We strongly recommend that you read the TeX Live Guide before
undertaking the installation.  It includes step-by-step instructions, a
description of the top-level directories, and more.

<p>If you are installing from the DVD image, the Guide in English and
all its translations are in the <a href="../texlive-doc">texlive-doc</a>
subdirectory.

<p>After installation, English versions of the Guide are in the <a
href="../texmf-dist/doc/texlive/texlive-en">texmf-dist/doc/texlive/</a>
hierarchy, in both <a
href="../texmf-dist/doc/texlive/texlive-en/texlive-en.html">html</a> and <a
href="../texmf-dist/doc/texlive/texlive-en/texlive-en.pdf">pdf</a>
formats. Translations to other languages are also available under <a
href="../texmf-dist/doc/texlive/">texmf-dist/doc/texlive</a>.

<p>We also provide a list of <a href="../doc.html">links to the
available PDF and HTML documentation</a> for the included packages and
programs.

<p>If you are installing from the Internet, the above links won't work.
In that case, you can view the <a
href="http://tug.org/texlive/doc.html">TeX Live documentation on the
Internet</a>.

<p>For a list of the most important changes in this year's release,
see the <i>Release history</i> section at the end of the documentation.


<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>The installation script is named <tt>install-tl</tt>
(<tt>install-tl-windows.bat</tt> on Windows), and it has three operation
modes:

<dl>
<dt><b>wizard</b></dt> (default on Windows) which asks a bare minimum of
questions and installs everything.  Can be specified explicitly with 
<tt>install-tl&nbsp;--gui=wizard</tt>.<p>

<dt><b>text</b></dt> (default on everything else) which has full customization
options.  Can be specified explicitly with
<tt>install-tl&nbsp;--gui=text</tt>.<p>

<dt><b>perltk</b></dt> which is a GUI for text; especially useful for
knowledgeable Windows users who don't want the defaults.  Can be
specified explicitly with <tt>install-tl&nbsp;--gui=perltk</tt>, or by
running <tt>install-tl-advanced.bat</tt> on Windows.

</dl>

<p>Post-installation package updates and other configurations are
performed with the <tt>tlmgr</tt> (TeX Live Package Manager) script,
which likewise has both GUI and text modes.

<p>You can give the command-line option <tt>--help</tt> to both <a
href="http://tug.org/texlive/doc/install-tl.html">install-tl</a> and <a
href="http://tug.org/texlive/tlmgr.html">tlmgr</a> for detailed
information on both programs.  See the documentation links above for
(much) more information.
