longdesc The package numprint prints numbers with a separator every
longdesc three digits and converts numbers given as 12345.6e789 to
longdesc 12\,345,6\cdot 10^{789}. Numbers are printed in the current
longdesc mode (text or math) in order to use the correct font. Many
longdesc things, including the decimal sign, the thousand separator, as
longdesc well as the product sign can be changed by the user, e.g., to
longdesc reach 12,345.6\times 10^{789}. If an optional argument is given
longdesc it is printed upright as unit. Numbers can be rounded to a
longdesc given number of digits. The package supports an automatic,
longdesc language-dependent change of the number format. Tabular
longdesc alignment using the tabular(*), array, tabularx, and longtable
longdesc environments (similar to the dcolumn and rccol packages) is
longdesc supported using all features of numprint. Additional text can
longdesc be added before and after the formatted number.
