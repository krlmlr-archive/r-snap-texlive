relocated 1
longdesc This is the public release of the qstest bundle (written for
longdesc DocScape Publisher) (C) 2006, 2007 QuinScape GmbH. The bundle
longdesc contains the packages 'makematch' for matching patterns to
longdesc targets (with a generalization in the form of pattern lists and
longdesc keyword lists), and 'qstest' for performing unit tests,
longdesc allowing the user to run a number of logged tests ensuring the
longdesc consistency of values, properties and call sequences during
longdesc execution of test code. Both packages make extensive use of in
longdesc their package documentation, providing illustrated examples
longdesc that are automatically verified to work as expected. Check the
longdesc README file for details.
