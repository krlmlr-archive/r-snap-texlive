shortdesc Donald Knuth's punk font.
relocated 1
longdesc A response to the assertion in a lecture that "typography tends
longdesc to lag behind other stylistic changes by about 10 years". Knuth
longdesc felt it was (in 1988) time to design a replacement for his
longdesc designs of the 1970s, and came up with this font! The fonts are
longdesc distributed as Metafont source. The package offers LaTeX
longdesc support by Rohit Grover, from an original by Sebastian Rahtz,
longdesc which is slightly odd in claiming that the fonts are T1-
longdesc encoded. A (possibly) more rational support package is to be
longdesc found in punk-latex
