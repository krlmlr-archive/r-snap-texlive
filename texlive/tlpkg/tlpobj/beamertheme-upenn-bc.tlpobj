shortdesc Beamer themies for Boston College and the University of Pennsylvania.
relocated 1
longdesc Beamer themes in the colors of the University of Pennsylvania,
longdesc USA, and Boston College, USA. Both were tested for the
longdesc presentation theme 'Warsaw. Please note that these color themes
longdesc are neither official nor exact! The colours are approximated
longdesc from the universities' style guidelines and websites, and
longdesc slightly modified where necessary to generate an appealing
longdesc look. The universities neither endorse, nor provide any support
longdesc for, these color themes. I give no warranty for the code.
