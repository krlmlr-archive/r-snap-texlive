longdesc The package aims to solve the error "No room for a new \write",
longdesc which occurs when the user, or when the user's packages have
longdesc 'allocated too many streams using \newwrite (TeX has a fixed
longdesc maximum number - 16 - such streams built-in to its code). The
longdesc package hooks into TeX primitive commands associated with
longdesc writing to files; it should be loaded near the beginning of the
longdesc sequence of loading packages for a document. The package uses
longdesc the l3kernel bundle.
