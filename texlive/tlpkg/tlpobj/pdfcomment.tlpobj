longdesc For a long time pdfLaTeX has offered the command \pdfannot for
longdesc inserting arbitrary PDF annotations. However, the command is
longdesc presented in a form where additional knowledge of the
longdesc definition of the PDF format is indispensable. This package is
longdesc an answer to the - occasional - questions in newsgroups, about
longdesc how one could use the comment function of Adobe Reader. At
longdesc least for the writer of LaTeX code, the package offers a
longdesc convenient and user-friendly means of using \pdfannot to
longdesc provide comments in PDF files. Since version v1.1,
longdesc pdfcomment.sty also supports LaTeX - dvips - ps2pdf, LaTeX -
longdesc dvipdfmx, and XeLaTeX. Unfortunately, support of PDF
longdesc annotations by PDF viewers is sparse to nonexistent. The
longdesc reference viewer for the development of this package is Adobe
longdesc Reader.
