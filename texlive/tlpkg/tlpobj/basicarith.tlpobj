shortdesc Macros for typesetting basic arithmetic.

longdesc The package provides macros for typesetting basic arithmetic,
longdesc in the style typically found in textbooks. It focuses on the
longdesc American style of performing these algorithms. It is written
longdesc mostly in low-level TeX, with the goal that it should run in
longdesc either plain TeX or LaTeX, but there are two constructions that
longdesc currently prevent this. It is highly configurable, with macros
longdesc and lengths described in the documentation.
