shortdesc Creates a list of all labels used throughout a document
relocated 1
longdesc The package aims to help a LaTeX author to keep track of all
longdesc defined labels by typesetting a complete list of labels
longdesc wherever the author requests it. (Of course, the user may need
longdesc to have additional LaTeX runs to get the references right. )
longdesc This package is based on an answer David Carlisle gave on
longdesc TeX/Stackexchange in the thread 'List of all labels with
longdesc hyperlinks'.
