longdesc PSfragX offers a mechanism to embed \psfrag commands, as
longdesc provided by the psfrag package, into the EPS file itself. Each
longdesc time a graphic is included, the EPS file is scanned. If some
longdesc tagged lines are found, they are used to define the psfrag
longdesc replacements that should be performed automatically. In
longdesc addition, a similar mechanism holds for overpic objects. These
longdesc are picture objects superimposed on the included graphic. A
longdesc similar mechanism is implemented in psfrag itself (but
longdesc deprecated in the documentation), but psfragx offers much more
longdesc flexibility. For example, if babel is used, it is possible to
longdesc define different replacements corresponding to different
longdesc languages. The replacements to take into account will be
longdesc selected on the basis of the current language of the document.
longdesc A Matlab script (LaPrint) is provided, to export an EPS file
longdesc with psfragx annotations ready embedded.
