shortdesc Extract and reinsert PDF annotations with pdfTeX.
longdesc If PDF files are included using pdfTeX, PDF annotations are
longdesc stripped. The pax project offers a solution without altering
longdesc pdfTeX. A Java program (pax.jar) parses the PDF file that will
longdesc later be included. The program then writes the data of the
longdesc annotations into a file that can be read by TeX. The LaTeX
longdesc package pax extends the graphics package to support the scheme:
longdesc if a PDF file is included, the package looks for the file with
longdesc the annotation data, reads them and puts the annotations in the
longdesc right place. Project status: experimental
