longdesc The files offer an Adobe Type 1 format version of the 5pt, 7pt
longdesc and 10pt versions of the bbold fonts. The distribution also
longdesc includes a map file, for use when incorporating the fonts into
longdesc TeX documents; the macros provided with the original Metafont
longdesc version of the font serve for the scaleable version, too. The
longdesc fonts were produced to be part of the TeX distribution from
longdesc Y&Y; they were generously donated to the TeX Users Group when
longdesc Y&Y closed its doors as a business.
