longdesc The package offers macros for making posters and banners with
longdesc TeX. It is compatible with most TeX macro formats, including
longdesc Plain TeX, LaTeX, AmSTeX, and AmS-LaTeX. The package creates a
longdesc poster as huge box, which is then distributed over as many
longdesc printer pages as necessary. The only special requirement is
longdesc that your printer not be bothered by text that lies off the
longdesc page. This is true of most printers, including laser printers
longdesc and PostScript printers.
