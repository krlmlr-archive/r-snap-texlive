longdesc The C.D.P. Bundle can be used to typeset high-quality business
longdesc letters formatted according to Italian style conventions. It is
longdesc highly configurable, and its modular structure provides you
longdesc with building blocks of increasing level, by means of which you
longdesc can compose a large variety of letters. It is also possible to
longdesc write letters divided into sections and paragraphs, to include
longdesc floating figures and tables, and to have the relevant indexes
longdesc compiled automatically. A single input file can contain several
longdesc letters, and each letter will have its own table of contents,
longdesc etc., independant from the other ones.
