longdesc The package provides a means to add a textual, light grey
longdesc watermark on every page or on the first page of a document.
longdesc Typical usage may consist in writing words such as DRAFT or
longdesc CONFIDENTIAL across document pages. The package performs a
longdesc similar function to that of draftcopy, but its implementation
longdesc is output device independent, and very made simple by relying
longdesc on everpage.
