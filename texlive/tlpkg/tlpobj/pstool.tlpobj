shortdesc Support for psfrag within pdfLaTeX.
relocated 1
longdesc The package works in the same sort of way as pst-pdf, but it
longdesc also processes the PostScript graphics with psfrag to add
longdesc labels within the graphic, before conversion. Thus the bundle
longdesc replaces two steps of an ordinary workflow. (Naturally, the
longdesc package requires that \write 18 is enabled.) Pstool ensures
longdesc that each version of each graphic is compiled once only (the
longdesc graphic is (re-)compiled only if it has changed since the
longdesc previous compilation of the document). This drastically speeds
longdesc up the running of the package in the typical case (though the
longdesc first run of any document is inevitably just as slow as with
longdesc any similar package).
