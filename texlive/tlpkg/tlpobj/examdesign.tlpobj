longdesc This bundle provides a class examdesign. The class provides
longdesc several features useful for designing tests or question sets:
longdesc it allows for explicit markup of questions and answers; the
longdesc class will, at the user's request, automatically generate
longdesc answer keys; multiple versions of the same test can be
longdesc generated automatically, with the ordering of questions within
longdesc each section randomly permuted so as to minimize cheating; the
longdesc generated answer keys can be constructed either with or without
longdesc the questions included; environments are provided to assist in
longdesc constructing the most common types of test question: matching,
longdesc true/false, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short
longdesc answer/essay questions.
