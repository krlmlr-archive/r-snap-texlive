Installation:
-------------

* ATTENTION: You need a complete LaTeX2e and some extra packages 
  (see below)!

  Copy all files to a directory, where TeX/LaTeX can find them.
  Run hc.ins through LaTeX or TeX, e.g. at UNIX type:
    latex hc.ins
  or
    tex hc.ins
  You'll get a couple of new cls-files and the file german.hld.
  Copy them to the coresponding LaTeX-directory.

  To get documentation (hc.dvi|ps) run hc.dtx through LaTeX, e.g. at UNIX
  type:
    latex hc.dtx 
  or:
    tex "&latex" hc.dtx
  or:
    latexps hc.dtx 
  You need three runs, to get table of contents and references right
  (latexps does this automatically).
