			CClicenses package

The cclicenses package helps users typesetting Creative Commons logos
in LaTeX. It defines some commands useful to quickly write these logos,
related to CC licenses versions 1.0 and 2.0.

This is my very first attempt to release a package I wrote and submit
it to the TeX community. Please, do give me some feedback to improve my
work or to know it's somehow useful.

The package comes with the files cclicenses.dtx and cclicenses.ins, this
README and the PDF manual _without_ the code (cclicenses_short.pdf). 
Running (pdf)latex on cclicenses.dtx will give you the manual ---either 
DVI or PDF--- with source code. To get cclicenses.sty, run (pdf)latex on 
cclicenses.ins. The files cclicenses.sty is needed to typeset the manual. 
Generate it first.

According to LPPL 1.3a, under which the package is released, here are some
data:

Status of the work: maintained
Author and current maintainer: Gianluca Pignalberi 
	<g.pignalberi@freesoftwaremagazine.com>
