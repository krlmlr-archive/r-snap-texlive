The use of bracketkey is explained below. See also the example in 
Malva.tex for how to use bracketkey. 

1. Use \begin{key}{<text>} and \end{key} to define the 
   bracketkey environment.

2. The second argument of \begin key can be used to pass 
   an abbreveated (genus) name to the 'name' command.

3. The two alternatives of each couplet are defined by:

        \leadONE{<backref>}{<text>} and 

   	\leadTWO{<text>}. 

   <backref> is an integer which refers to the previous couplet 
   number, in case that the current and the previouos couplet
   numbers are not consecutive.

4. Each 'lead' command is followed by a 'name' command:

	\name{<text>}{<text|integer>}{<text>}
	
   <text> in the first argument is set in boldface. It can be used 
   for taxon ranks which do not require italized writing.

   <text> in the second argument is set in italics. It typically 
   takes names of genus rank and below. Alternatively, <integer> 
   refers to the next couplet.

   <text> in the third argument is set "as is". It can be used to provide 
   authority names.
