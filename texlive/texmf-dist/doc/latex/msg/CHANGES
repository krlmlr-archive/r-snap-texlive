% Here are the historical changes in the "msg" package for LaTeX.

2006/11/09  V 0.50 mods: Makefile did'nt worked correctly (wrong files moved)
                         for TeXLive production.
                         Wrongly installed "msg" package, as in TeXLive 2005 
                         now detected (file msg-msg.tex not found).

2006/10/03  V 0.40 mods: no options are declared and processed when the "msg"
                         package is called internally (from another package)
                         or from the kernel. This is just a test if 
                         \intern@c@llfrom is undefined or not. \intern@c@llfrom
                         should contain the name of module calling (for future
                         use).
                   Added a Makefile to prepare for TeXLive.
                   Added this CHANGES file.

2005/02/14  V 0.30 mods: added hook for possible keyboard output reencoding;
                         few documentation changes.

                                         \begin{document};
                                         German message file completed.
                                         Few documentation changes.
