Input or include stand-alone LaTeX documents. Only the content
of the document environment is retained and the rest is
discarded.

To install the package you only need to put docmute.sty style
file where LaTeX can find it. To extract the files and typeset
the documentation run pdflatex on docmute.dtx. Alternatively,
run tex on it to extract only.
