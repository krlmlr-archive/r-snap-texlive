anyfontsize.sty is a LaTeX2e package that lets the user select any 
font size (via e.g. \fontsize{...}{...}\selectfont), even those 
sizes that are not listed in the .fd file. If such a size is requested, 
LaTeX will search the nearest listed size, and anyfontsize will scale 
that font to the requested size. For a similar functionality that 
works only for the CM fonts, try the type1cm.sty package, or, even 
better, use the new Latin Modern (LM) fonts, which are available at 
any size.
