makeshape 2.1 (25 January 2013)

The makeshape package simplifies writing PGF shapes.

Declaring custom shapes with correct anchor borders can be difficult. 
Complex shapes often need complicated calculations to find the touching 
point of a connecting line. This package only requires that a developer 
write a PGF path describing the anchor border. It also provides macros 
that help with the management of shape parameters, and the definition 
of anchor points.

The package's documentation files are

makeshape.pdf   - The package's user guide
sampleshape.tex - A sample shape.
testsample.tex  - Source for a document that tests the sample shape. 
testsample.pdf  - The outcome of the tests.
ontesting.pdf   - A report on the various tests used in testsample.tex

The package's installation files are

makeshape.sty   - The package's style file

makeshape.ins   - The package's installation file.
makeshape.dtx   - Source for the package's user documentation and code.
ontesting.dtx   - Source for a report on testing and code for the test

These files can be generated with the following commands 

pdflatex makeshape.ins
pdflatex makeshape.dtx
pdflatex ontesting.dtx
