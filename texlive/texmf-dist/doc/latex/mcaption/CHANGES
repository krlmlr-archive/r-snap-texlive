v3.0 2009/03/13
---------------
New:
  * Obey \caption and \label commands inside margincap
      (at last!).
  * Macro \margincapalign is deprecated (no longer
      necessary for tabular declarations).
  * New compatibility option `v2.2'.

Incompatible changes:
  * Environment margincap has no arguments.  A
      compatibility option exists, that restores the old
      syntax with caption arguments.
  * The mcaption package requires package changepage to be
      installed (instead of chngpage).
  * Complete revision of the vertical alignment mechanism.
      Paragraph-breaking might be affected (hopefully only
      to the better).

Fixed:
  * In one-sided documents chngpage/changepage's even/odd
      page detection was subtly broken by the mcaption
      package.


---------------
v2.2 2005/09/30
---------------

Fixed:

      margin.
