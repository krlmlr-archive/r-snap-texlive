             README for the `morehype' bundle
                 Some more hypertext tools 
                 (C) Uwe Lueck 2012/11/28

The bundle consists of three (or six) packages:

 `texlinks.sty'  shorthand macros for TeX-related external 
                 hyperlinks with hyperref or `blog.sty' below 
                 or ...?

 `hypertoc.sty'  with hyperref, colorlinks=false rehabilitated
                 - struts in table of content macros 
                 (and decent border colors in `makedoc.cfg')

     `blog.sty'  fast generation of simple HTML by expanding 
                 TeX macros (LaTeX names where possible), not 
                 involving TeX's typesetting capabilities, 
                 based on file processing with `fifinddo.sty' 
                 (`nicetext' bundle)

  `blogdot.sty'  beamer presentations with `blog.sty'
 
 `blogexec.sty'  assignments and "ligatures" with `blog.sty'

 `lnavicol.sty'  web pages with a left-hand navigation column, 
                 based on `blog.sty'

The packages are described in more detail in `blog.pdf', 
`hypertoc.pdf', and `texlinks.pdf' (`doc' CTAN directory;
typeset using fifinddo.sty, makedoc.sty, niceverb.sty from the 
`nicetext' bundle, http://ctan.org/pkg/nicetext).
