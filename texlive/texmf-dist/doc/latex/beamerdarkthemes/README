CHANGELOG:
0.4.1: add package version on *sty, *tex files. Licenced *jpg and
example.tex CC-BY. Add changelog to README
0.4: change magpie to cormorant; create two new themes: magpie and
frigatebird. New files for uploading to CTAN:
beamerdarkthemesuserguide.tex, example.tex and their derivative,
img_5630.jpg and dahut.jpg
0.3: change magpie green dominant color from green!50!black to
green!50!white to avoid unreadable description items on dark rendering
projectors. New file: makeexample.sh for testing purpose.
0.2: drop Cracow and oneline; add sidebar color themes to
beamercolorthememagpie.sty
0.1: magpie color theme, as well as Cracow theme and oneline
outer theme.
