This is the README file for the 'textgreek' package.

textgreek - text symbols for the Greek alphabet

SUMMARY

The LaTeX package textgreek provides NFSS text symbols for Greek
letters. This way an author can use Greek letters in text without
changing to math mode. The usual font selection commands---e.g.
\textbf---apply to these Greek letters as to usual text and the font
is upright in an upright environment. Further, hyperref can use these
symbols in PDF-strings such as PDF-bookmarks.

To produce the textgreek.sty file run

    latex textgreek.ins
