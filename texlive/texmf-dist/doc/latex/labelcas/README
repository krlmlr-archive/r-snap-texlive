This Work consists of the files labelcas.dtx, labelcas.ins, README and the
derived files labelcas.sty and labelcas.pdf.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributed files include:

   README        -- This file
   labelcas.pdf  -- Preformatted documentation
   labelcas.sty  -- Package-file for inclusion in document-preambles
   labelcas.ins  -- Extracts .sty-file from .dtx-file
   labelcas.dtx  -- Combined source both of .sty-file and documentation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

Place labelcas.ins and labelcas.dtx into directories searched by TeX.
In order to obtain the .sty-file, run TeX or LaTeX2e or pdfTeX or
pdfLaTeX2e on labelcas.ins.
In order to obtain the documentation, place labelcas.sty into a
directory searched by TeX and run (pdf)LaTeX2e on labelcas.dtx.
Index:          makeindex -s gind.ist -o labelcas.ind labelcas.idx
Change-history: makeindex -s gglo.ist -o labelcas.gls labelcas.glo

If you wish to obtain information about usage of the macros while
omitting sections related to package-implementation and change-
history, enable "\OnlyDescription" by activating line 42/removing
the leading percent-char from line 42 in the file labelcas.dtx
before compiling.

Paper-format of the documentation is a4. If you wish to have the
documentation in letter-paper, it should be sufficient to remove
the a4paper-option in line 29 of the file labelcas.dtx before
compiling.

Within the source-code for the documentation, the hyperref-package is
used. If you wish to obtain the documentation without (colorized)
hyperlinks (e.g., for printing), make sure that the hyperref-package
is loaded with the "draft"-option by activating line 34/removing the
leading percent-char from line 34 in the file labelcas.dtx before
compiling.
