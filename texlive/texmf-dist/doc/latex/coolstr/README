Description
-----------

The coolstr package is a subpackage of the cool package that deals with the 
manipulation of strings.  A string is defined as a sequence of characters 
(not tokens).

The package provides the ability to access a specific character of a string, 
as well as determine if the string contains numeric or integer data.

Installation
------------

To install this package, run coolstr.ins through LaTeX.  This will generate 
a file called coolstr.sty.  Put this file somewhere where LaTeX will find 
it---for instance localtexmf/tex/latex/coolstr/  (note that you will need 
to create the folder coolstr).

If you are using MikTeX, you then need to refresh the file name database 
by using MikTeX Options
