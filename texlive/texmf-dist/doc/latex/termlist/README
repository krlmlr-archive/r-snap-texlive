The termlist package provides environments to typeset lists of
numbered terms, where the "terms" may contain anything printable.
The list of terms is formatted to look consistent to a list of
mathematical equations inside an eqnarray environment.  Also for
consistency, the same equation counter is used for numbering.  You
may think of termlist as a generalisation of the eqnarray
environment, if you want to typeset more than just mathematics.
