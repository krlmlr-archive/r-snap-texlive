Description
===========

The cooltooltips package enables a document to contain hyperlinks that
pop up a brief tooltip when the mouse moves over them and also open a
small window containing additional text.  cooltooltips provides the
mechanism used by the Visual LaTeX FAQ
(http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/visualFAQ/) to indicate the
question that each hyperlink answers.

cooltooltips works only with pdfLaTeX.  Furthermore, the tooltips that
cooltooltips produces are much less cool when viewed under older
versions of Acrobat (< 7.0) or the current version of xpdf (3.00)
because they don't pop up the extra, small window.


Installation
============

There's nothing special about building cooltooltips.  To create
cooltooltips.sty simply run "tex cooltooltips.ins".  Install
cooltooltips.sty somewhere where pdfLaTeX can find it.  See
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=instpackages for
general information about installing packages.
