0. Introduction

diagnose.sty, if included as a package, helps identify available
and necessary but missing files, packages and tokens.

diagnose.sty can be used by texts and other packages. For every
file or token checked it provides a counter and a set of messages,
one message if the file or token is found, the other for an absent
token or file.


1. Installation and Use

Unpack the archive diagnose.zip in some temporary directory.
Copy the file diagnose.sty to a place where your TeX installation
can find it. Rehash the directory database, if possible (not all
distributions provide this possibility).

The counter provided by diagnose.sty can be used to trigger appropriate
activity, either in the form of program branches or in the form of
variable texts. Messages can appear in log files and documents.

See diagnose.tex for a complete documentation and mls-diag.tex for
a live example of what this is all about.
