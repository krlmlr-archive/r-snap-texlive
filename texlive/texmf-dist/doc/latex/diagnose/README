Package name:		diagnose.sty
Package authors:	Oliver Corff
Version/Release:	version 0.2

Features:

This tool, diagnose.sty, is thought useful for package authors who
want to facilitate the successful distribution of their packages.
It helps the user (and the system administrator) to see what has to
be done *before* a new package is installed.

diagnose.sty provides simple high-level tools for checking
the existence of files and tokens. Software action can be
triggered, messages can appear in log files and documents.

Compiling the example mls-diag.tex and reading its source text will
show the idea behind this little utility.

Installation:

Unpack this archive and copy diagnose.sty to some place where
your LaTeX installation can find it. Rehash the directory database.
That's it!
