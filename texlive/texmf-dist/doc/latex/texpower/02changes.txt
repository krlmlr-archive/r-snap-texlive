## TeXPower 0.2 - April 8, 2005

Changes in texpower.sty v0.2:

 - Fixed bugs #1029803 and #1073319 reported at SourceForge.
 - Made the handling of whatsits smarter (making write to file and hyperref
   commands stepwise-aware), i.e, relaxed filtering. 
 - Added option/command to turn on/off the old aggressive/robust filtering. 
 - Added fragilesteps environment.

Other changes in TeXPower bundle:

 - For tplists.sty v0.2:
   - Added flipdesc, stepdesc, dimdesc lists for easy dynamic description lists. 
   - Improved behaviour when not in display mode.
   - Fixed step lists behaviour when in display mode, but without colors.
   - Added noflipendstep option and a setup command to enable setting of all options
     anywhere in the document.
 - Updated documentation and improved examples/demos.
 - No other packages or classes changed.

## TeXPower 0.1b - July 27, 2004

Changes in texpower.sty since v0.0.9d:

 - Removed font stuff (now resides in tpslifonts.sty).
 - Fixed display errors with some packages like pdfscreen  related to \shipout
 - Color management extended a little to integrate better with LaTeX.
 - Made \step-like commands give better error messages when outside \stepwise.
 - Moved source to dtx-format. This made the examples/demos much easier to
   read.

Other changes in texpower bundle since v0.0.9d:

 - powersem.cls and tpslifonts.sty now in dtx format. (No other changes.)
 - tpslifonts documentation moved out of manual.tex and into tpslifonts.dtx
 - manual updated, only minor changes.
 - tplists.sty. New (experimental) addon package for texpower which provides easy
   dynamic lists.  Currently there are stepped, flipped and dimmed versions of
   itemize and enumerate (and corresponding lists from the eqlist and paralist
   package).
