\section{A list environment}

% The \pause command `splits' the current page at the place it appears, producing two pages, one with everything which
% came before the \pause command, one containing this and additionally the stuff coming after \pause. When these pages
% are presented with acrobar reader in full screen mode (or any other viewer with this capability), the presentation
% will appear to `stop' at the point the \pause command was issued and `resume' in the moment the presenter switches to
% the next page.

\pause

% As \pause forces a paragraph break, it can not be used to separate a description label from the associated text. For
% this, we use the (very flexible) \stepwise command. Inside the argument of \stepwise, an arbitrary number of \step
% commands may occur. \stepwise will produce as many pages as there are \step commands, making the arguments of the
% \step commands appear ``one by one''.

\stepwise
{%
  \begin{description}
  \item[foo.] \step{bar.}
  \step{\item[baz.]} \step{qux.}
  \end{description}
  }



\section{An aligned equation}

\pause

% Normally for \stepwise, if a \step is not yet active, its argument is ignored completely. This would disturb
% alignments, because the width changes with every new activated \step.
% \parstepwise is a variant of \stepwise where the argument of an inactive \step is put into a \phantom, leaving the
% proper amount of white space.

\parstepwise
{%
  % Using eqnarray with equation numbers here means all equation numbers will be visible from the outset, because only
  % the contents of the lines are `filled in'. See the full demo for an example of aligned equations where equation
  % numbers `appear'.
  \begin{eqnarray}
    %
    % When the argument of \step is put into a box (as it happens with \parstepwise), tabulators can not go in there. As
    % we want the equals sign to appear at the same time as the right side of the equation, we use \restep for the
    % latter. \restep is like \step, but it appears at the same time as the previous \step command.
    %
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} i & \step{=} & \restep{1 + 2 + \cdots + (n-1) + n}\\
    %
                     & \step{=} & \restep{1 + n + 2 + (n-1) + \cdots}\\
    %
                     & \step{=} & \restep
                                  {% We can nest \step commands inside each other. The order of execution is just the
                                   % order of appearance, independent of nesting.
                                   % \switch is a variant of \step which takes two arguments and toggles between them on
                                   % activation. This way, we can make the \underbrace `appear'.
                                   % We insert a \vphantom in the first argument so that the equation numbers will be
                                   % placed correctly whether or not the underbrace is didplayed.
                                    \switch
                                    {%
                                      \vphantom{\underbrace{(1 + n) + \cdots + (1 + n)}_{\times\frac{n}{2}}}%
                                      (1 + n) + \cdots + (1 + n)%
                                      }
                                    {\underbrace{(1 + n) + \cdots + (1 + n)}_{\times\frac{n}{2}}}%
                                    }
                                  \\
    %
    % This is another nested application of \step. Note that the spacing of \cdot has to be corrected manually by
    % inserting {} left of it, because otherwise it would behave like a prefix operator.
    %
                     & \step{=} & \restep{\frac{(1 + n)\step{{}\cdot n}}{\restep{2}}}
  \end{eqnarray}
}




\section{An array}

\stepwise
{% With arrays, beware of problems with automatic calculation of cell widths.
 %
 % If you want all widths to be calculated automatically, you need to use \parstepwise, with the consequence that
 %   a) tabulators or newlines can not go into the argument of \step,
 %   b) the array `structure' (rules) will be completely visible right from the beginning.
 %
 % If you want to use \stepwise for being able to build the `structure' (like \hilne's) dynamically (as done in the
 % following), you have to make sure that the cell widths are correct from the very first line, because otherwise the
 % array will expand horizontally, destroying the dynamic effect. This can be assured by
 %   a) using only p cells,
 %   b) making sure all the cells in the first line are at least as wide as the widest cell which will appear later. If
 %      you are using the calc package, this is easiest by putting \makebox[\widthof{widest entry}]{first entry} into
 %      the first cell. Otherwise, you can use \settowidth.
 %
  \begin{displaymath}
    \begin{array}{rrrrr}
      \step
      {%
            n &        \log n        &        n\log n       & \lefteqn{n^2}\phantom{25} & \lefteqn{2^n}\phantom{32} \\
