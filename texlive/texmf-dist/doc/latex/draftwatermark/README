The "draftwatermark" package extends LaTeX providing a means to add a
textual gray or colored watermark on every page or on the first page
of a document. Typical usage may consist in writing words such as
"DRAFT" or "CONFIDENTIAL" across document pages. The package may
remind in some sense "draftcopy" by Dr. Juergen Vollmer, but its
implementation is much lighter (as the reduced code footprint shows)
and does not rely on postscript specials, making the package fully
compatible with pdfLaTeX. The package depends on package "everypage"
by the same author.
