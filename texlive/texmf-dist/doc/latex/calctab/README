calctab package - A language for numeric tables
version 0.6.1 2009/07/12

1 - Introduction
The calctab package helps the user to typeset a kind of economic table such as invoices,
expense notes and liquidation, or other tabular material with a values columns.
The code computes sum and percentage with floating point numeric method (with the fltpoint
package by Eckhart Guthoehrlein) and builds the render table task.
Economics items may be are independent values or not like sums and percentage on previous
values. The language must be expressive concerning together data and its relationships.

2 - Calctab and xcalctab environments
The calctab environment allow you to typesetting a table with only one values column
beside a label and a description columns.
In the xcalctab environment the values of two columns are multiplied and the result
is printed in a third column.
Please read the calctab user manual for more information and example.

3 - Language
A standard tabular environment works well but force the user to think in a generic LaTeX
language without a conceptual relation among the items. In addition a lot of formatting
commands takes the same relevance of the main data.

4 - Feedback and language enhancements
This version waiting for the user help and feedback and somehow a powerful implemented
language to adjust all the view property such as row numbering, label type, coloring, etc.
Finally, I hope in a new infrastructure design which allow to building table with an
object oriented language (ool).
