____________________
The HYPHENAT package

    The hyphenat package can be used to disable all hyphenation
in a document or in selected text within the document. It also 
enables hyphenation within `words' that contain analphabetic 
characters (e.g., that include underscores), and hyphenation of
text typeset in monospaced (e.g., CM typewriter) fonts.
