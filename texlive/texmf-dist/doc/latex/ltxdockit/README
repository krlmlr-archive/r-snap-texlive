ABOUT

This bundle consisting of a simple wrapper class and some packages
forms a small LaTeX/BibTeX documentation kit. Please note that there
is no support whatsoever for this software. There is also no
documentation at all. The sole purpose of releasing this software is
to make sure that the source of the manuals which ship with the
csquotes, etoolbox, and biblatex packages may be compiled using a
toolchain which is DFSG-free from end to end. There is no guarantee
that these packages can be used for anything beyond that. They are
not meant to be an all-purpose LaTeX documentation kit.
