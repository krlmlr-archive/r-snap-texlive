LaTeX Package : xfor

Last Modified : 5 February 2009
Version       : 1.05
Author        : Nicola Talbot

This package redefines \@for so that it is possible to
prematurely terminate the loop. There is also a look ahead
facility to access the next element before moving on to the
next iteration.

The package is supplied using the TeX Directory Structure (TDS).
Files in texmf directory should go in the corresponding
$LOCALTEXMF directories.

*Remember to refresh TeX's database*

The package and documentation source code is also supplied as a
dtx and ins file located in texmf/source.
