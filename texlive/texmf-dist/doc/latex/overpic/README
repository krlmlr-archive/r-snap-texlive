This small LaTeX package defines the overpic environment which is
a combination between a picture environment and an includegraphics
command (defined in graphicx). The resulting picture environment has
the same dimension as the included eps graphic. Now it is easy possible
to put any LaTeX output above the graphic on defined positions. A grid
to aid is also possible.

This directory contains the following files:

README       - This file.
README.de    - The same in german.
overpic.sty  - The definition of overpic. Required graphicx.sty and epic.sty.
opic-rel.tex
and
opic-abs.tex - Two demos that shows all the features. You need the eps graphic 
               file golfer.ps. This file is part of ghostscript´s  examples 
	       directory.
