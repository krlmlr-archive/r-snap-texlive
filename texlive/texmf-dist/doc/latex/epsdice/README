Distributed files:

   epsdice.ins      -- docstrip installer file
   epsdice.dtx      -- source and sample doc
   dice.pdf         -- dice drawings in pdf format
   README           -- this file
   epsdice.pdf      -- documentation (from LaTeX -> dvips -> pstopdf)

Generated files:
 
   epsdice.sty      -- the package
   epsdice.cfg      -- a config file
   dice.eps         -- dice drawings in eps format

Test installation:

With all distributed files in your present
working directory, run epsdice.ins through LaTeX.
To test the package, you can reproduce the documentation 
(epsdice.pdf) by running epsdice.dtx (twice) through pdfLaTeX 
or through LaTeX -> dvips -> pstopdf. 

If you decide to keep the package, move the files 
  epsdice.sty epsdice.cfg dice.eps dice.pdf
to /tex/latex/epsdice in your local texmf tree 
according to the instructions in epsdice.dtx/ins.
