The moreverb package is a miscellany of verbatim facilities,
originally provided as a LaTeX 2.09 package.

The present instance has been ported to current LaTeX (2e), tidied and
mended in various ways by David Carlisle and Morten H\o gholm.

Some of the facilities of the original package are no longer provided
in this package, since they duplicated those of the LaTeX required
verbatim package (which this package loads) or the alltt package
(which is now part of the LaTeX distribution).

The package is distributed under the LPPL.
