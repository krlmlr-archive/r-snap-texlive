Version 1.24:
Added csvsort.sty (requires xfor package and \'Eamonn McManus' 
compare.tex)

Version 1.23:
\par can now be used in entries (but all entries for a given
row must be on the same line, so you can't use a blank line
to indicate a paragraph break.)

Version 1.22:
\applyCSVfile now resets each field to nothing before scanning each
row so that if a column is missing for a given row, that entry will
be blank. (Note that this does not apply to the starred version, as 
the header row is used to determine the maximum number of columns.)
\csvSaveEntry has an additional optional argument to supply text if
that entry is omitted. 

Version 1.21:
 Fixed problem caused when first field starts with repeated 
character

Version 1.2:
 added csvpie.sty
 data separator can now be user defined
 entries enclosed within double quotes are now parsed correctly

Version 1.1 has the new command \CSVtolongtable (analogous to \CSVtotabular)
and a Perl script. See documentation for details.
