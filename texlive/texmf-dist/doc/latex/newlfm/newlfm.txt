\texttt{newlfm} is a letter class.  It allows the user to author letters.  It is
designed to improve on the default \LaTeX\ \texttt{letter} class in several ways. 

More flexible placement of information is allowed.  It allows flexible
positioning of address blocks (date, from-block, to-block, signature).  They may
be flush right, flush left or centered.  Each may be positioned separately.
Commands are included to modify the spacing between blocks.

Using the \texttt{fancyhdr} and \texttt{geometry} styles, \texttt{newlfm}
allows the inclusion of letterhead-style information.  The user encases the
object to be placed in the form in a box, and then supplies it to
\texttt{newlfm}.  \texttt{newlfm} then determines the appropriate margins.
\LaTeX tools for image management may be used (\texttt{graphics}).
Additionally, the user may include these boxes containing letterhead
information, but not print them; this allows precise placement on
pre-printed letterhead stationary.

Memos may be printed using the same tools as letters.  Thus, addresses (if
requested) may be printed on the memo in the same manner as addresses are
printed on letters.  Several versions of the memo header are supported. 

\texttt{newlfm} uses an address book.  The address book allows the user
to include addresses in a single file, within a ``wrapper macro.'' The
addresses are  then included in a letter using a single command, the name of
the wrapper.  This is very convenient, as addresses need be typed once, and
thereafter used via the wrapper name.  

\texttt{newlfm} supports mass-mailing of form letters.  This is done by
specifying a common body (which may include macros to allow customization).
Addresses for repeat mailings may then be specified.

Envelopes may be prepared with either the \texttt{envlab} package.  This
enables the address used in the letter to be printed on a following page
immediately.  Several versions of Avery labels are also supported. 

\texttt{newlfm} will print a fax header page at the start for either the
letter or memo approach.
