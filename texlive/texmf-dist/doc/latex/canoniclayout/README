Canoniclayout v.04

Canoniclayout is a small extension that allows to design a canonic layout based on the great circle inscribed within the page and tangent to the horizontal sides of the type block rectangle. The margins reflect the trimmed page shape ratio, therefore the type block principal diagonal coincides with the corresponding page diagonal; this layout is especially good for ISO shapes but can be used with many other traditional book page shapes.
