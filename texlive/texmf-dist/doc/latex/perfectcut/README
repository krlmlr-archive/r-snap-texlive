perfectcut.sty

This package defines the command \perfectcut#1#2 which displays a
bracket <#1||#2>. Its effect is to determine the size of the bracket
depending on the number of nested \perfectcut (regardless of the
contents). It is intended for use:
- In proof theory, for term notations of sequent calculus,
- In computer science, for the modeling of abstract machines.

This package also offers a reimplementation of \big, \bigg, etc. into
arbitrary-size variants.
