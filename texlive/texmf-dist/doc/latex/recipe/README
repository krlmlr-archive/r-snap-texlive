The file "recipe.cls" is a LaTeX-2e class file to typeset recipes;
an example is included, in form of an input file "sample.tex" and
of the final PostScript file "sample.ps".  I am sorry, but the
example is in Italian; but, what the general user may be interested
in, is the page layout and not real recipes :-)   .

The PostScript file requires Bookman (in the printer, or in
GhostScript) and BrushScript-Italic (included as a .pfa font in
sample.ps); this last font, that I have contributed a few years
ago, is available on CTANs in /tex-archive/fonts/brushscr with
all its .tfm, .fd and .vf files.

All of these files are public domain; but the author will gladly
receive comments and all your modifications.
