This is the README file for the 'storecmd' package.

VERSION

Version 0.0.1, October 2011.

SUMMARY

This package provides macros for command definition that save the
name of the command being defined in a file or a macro container.
Even when the user uses a syntax similar to that of \newcommand, 
some or all of the parameters of the defined command can be delimited,
as desired by the command author.

It was written in response to a post on comp.text.tex for a macro
that will define commands and also save the commands being defined
in a file or a container macro, eg, for spelling exceptions. Three
macros are provided for this purpose:

\defsavecmd<cmd><param>{<defn>}
\newsavecmd<cmd><param>{<defn>}
\renewsavecmd<cmd><param>{<defn>}

Here <cmd> is the command name, <param> is the parameter list, and
<defn> is the replacement text. In \defsavecmd, the <param> list is
as in \def; in \newsavecmd and \renewsavecmd, the <param> list is
as in \newcommand. \defsavecmd will overwrite an existing command;
both \newsavecmd and \renewsavecmd will not do so.

The commands \defsavecmd, \newsavecmd and \renewsavecmd may be
prefixed by \globalcmd and/or \protectedcmd to yield global or robust
definitions, respectively. For example,

\defsavecmd\cmda#1#2{xxx#1#2}
\globalcmd\defsavecmd\cmdb#1#2{xxx#1#2}
\globalcmd\newsavecmd\cmdc[2]{xxx#1#2}
\protectedcmd\globalcmd\renewsavecmd*\cmda[2][zz]{\def\y##1{##1xxx}}

The parameters of \defsavecmd can readily be delimited as in the case
of \def. The parameters of \newsavecmd and \renewsavecmd can be
delimited as follows:

\newsavecmd<cmd><param>(<delimiters>){<defn>}
\renewsavecmd<cmd><param>(<delimiters>){<defn>}

The <delimiters>, given in parenthesis, have the syntax:

1<\delim1> 2<\delim2> ... 9<\delim9>

where <\delim1> is the delimiter for the first parameter, etc. Only the
parameters with delimiters are to be specified in <delimiters>.
For example,

\protectedcmd\newsavecmd\cmda[2](1\@nil 2\@mil){xxx#1#2}
\newsavecmd\cmdb[9][yy](3\@nil 9\@mil){xxx#1#2#3...#9}

When the first argument is optional, then it can't have a delimiter,
since the delimiter for that parameter is already '[]'.


The package options are

neversave  -  Never save/store the new commands in the container
              file or command. The new commands will still be defined.
              Default: false

storerenew -  Allow the storage of a command that has already
              been stored. This is used by \renewsavecmd.
              Default: false.

overwrite -   Allow overwrite of an existing container file or
              command. Default: false.

storefile -   Container file. Default: cmdnamesfile.

storecmd  -   Container command. Default: cmdnamesmacro.

verbose   -   Give extra information in the transcript file.
              Default: true. Turn this off if you don't like
              or need such information.


EXAMPLE FILE

\begin{filecontents}{storecmd-example.tex}
\documentclass{article}
% Container commands are also accepted as package options,
% but in this case 'catoptions' must be loaded before
% \usepackage{storecmd}.
% Eg,
%   \usepackage{catoptions}
%   \usepackage[storecmd=\mycommands]{storecmd}
%
% Uncomment the next line to test what happens when
% an existing command is being refilled:
% \def\mycommands{}

\usepackage[
  storerenew=true,storecmd=mycommands,storefile=mycommands
]{storecmd}

\defsavecmd\cmda#1#2{xxx#1#2}
\globalcmd\defsavecmd\cmdb#1#2{xxx#1#2}
\globalcmd\newsavecmd\cmdc[2]{xxx#1#2}
\globalcmd\newsavecmd\cmdd[2][yy]{xxx#1#2}
\protectedcmd\globalcmd\renewsavecmd*\cmda[2][zz]{\def\y##1{##1xxx}}
\newsavecmd\cmde[2](1\@nil 2\@mil){xxx#1#2}
\newsavecmd\cmdf[9][yy](2\@nil 3\@mil){xxx#1#2#3...#9}

% Try \show\mycommands or see file 'mycommands.tex'.
