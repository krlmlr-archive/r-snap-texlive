Parshape macros for LaTeX2e
---------------------------

Provides a front-end to the standard TeX \parshape macro. Allows
length registers to be reused, and \parshape commands to be generated
using loops and other TeX and LaTeX constructs.


Example usage:

\newlength{\len}

\begin{parshapecollect}
 \setlength{\len}{1em}
 \parshapelenout{\len} \parshapelenout{15em}
 \addtolength{\len}{6em}
 \parshapelenout{\len} \parshapelenout{9em}
 \addtolength{\len}{1em}
 \parshapelenout{0em} \parshapelenout{\len}
\end{parshapecollect}
\texttt{The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.}


Produces (assuming a tt font with 1em per character):

 The quick brown
       fox jumps
over the
lazy dog



Commands are also available to process arrays of lengths in various
different ways; see PDF documentation for details.
