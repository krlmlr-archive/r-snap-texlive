Overview

The idxlayout package offers a key--value interface to configure index
layout parameters, e.g. allowing for three-column indexes or for
"parent" items and their affiliated subitems being typeset as a single
paragraph. The package is responsive to the index-related options and
commands of the KOMA-Script- and memoir classes.
