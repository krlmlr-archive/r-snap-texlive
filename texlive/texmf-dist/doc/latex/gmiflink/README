2. Introduction

The gmiflink.sty package protects you against an error when a link is
dangling and typesets some plain text instead of a hyperlink then. It
is intended for use with the hyperref.sty package.

I used it for typesetting the names of the objects in a documentation
of a computer program. If the object had been defined a \hyperlink to its
definition was made, otherwise a plain object's name was typeset.
I also use this package in automatic making of hyperlinking indexes.

It provides the macros \gmiflink, \gmifref and
\gmhypertarget for conditional making of hyperlinks in your document.

\gmhypertarget makes a \hypertarget and a \label of the given name.

\gmiflink makes a \hyperlink to the given \hypertarget if the
correspondent label exists, otherwise typesets an ordinary text.

\gmifref makes a (hyper-)\ref to the given label if the label exists,
otherwise it typesets an ordinary text.


3. Installation

Just put the gmiflink.sty somewhere in the texmf/tex/latex
branch. Creating a /texmf/tex/latex/gm directory may be advisable if
you consider using other packages written by me.

Then you should refresh your TeX distribution's files'
database most probably.


4. Contents

The distribution of this package consists of the following three files.

gmiflink.sty
README
gmiflink.pdf


5. Documentation

The last of the above files (the .pdf) is a documentation compiled
from the .sty file by running LaTeX (twice) on the gmiflink.sty
file:
xelatex gmiflink.sty
 in the directory you wish the documentation to be in, 
you don't have copy the .sty file  there---TeX will find it.
Compiling of the documentation requires the packages: gmdoc
(gmdoc.sty and gmdocc.cls), gmverb.sty, gmutils.sty and also some
standard packages: hyperref.sty, xcolor.sty, geometry.sty,
multicol.sty, lmodern.sty, fontenc.sty that should be installed
on your computer by default.

If you have not installed the mwart.cls class (available on CTAN in
mwcls package), the result of your compilation may differ a bit from
the .pdf provided in this .zip archive in formattings: If you have not
installed mwart.cls, the standard article.cls will be used.
