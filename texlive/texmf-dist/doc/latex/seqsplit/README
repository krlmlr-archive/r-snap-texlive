Sometimes one needs to typeset long sentences of letters, which should
not have spaces between them (like letters in words), but could be
split between lines at any point, often without a hyphenation
character.  This problem was formulated at the PracticalTeX-2006
conference by Klaus Hoeppner.  In the general discussion several
solutions were suggested.  This package implements the one belonging
to, I believe, Peter Flynn.
