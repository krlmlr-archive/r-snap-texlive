This is the package spotcolor for pdfLaTeX.
It provides procedures for using spot colors in LaTeX documents
and the generated pdf files. Predefined templates for PANTONE and
HKS color spaces are included but new ones can easily be defined.

For detailed usage information please refer to readme.pdf.
