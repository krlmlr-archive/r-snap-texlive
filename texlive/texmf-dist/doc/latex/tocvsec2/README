The TOCVSEC2 package

    The tocvsec2 package provides control over sectional numbering and/or the
entries in the Table of Contents on a section by section basis. 
NB. The package also requires the ifthen package.

Change history

version 1.3a (2014/03/10)
- Missing % in a definition was causing a spacing issue.
  Thanks: http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/164612

version 1.3 (2011/08/07)
- New commands \resettocdepth and \resetsecnumdepth
  used for resetting to previous values of the tocdepth
  and secnumdepth counters (using a stack-based approach).
  With optional star argument can reset to the original
  `max' values.

- Bug fix that resets "tocdepth" to its original value after
  the \tableofcontents -- else it will adversely affect
  subsequent List of Figures/Tables (or cause no harm,
  either way).

version 1.2b (2010/02/27)
- Bug fix for extraneous vertical space before sections
  (This may change the typesetting of documents that use
   this package. The price of a bug fix, unfortunately.)

version 1.2a (2009/09/04)
- New maintainer (Will Robertson)

version 1.2 (2004/05/24)
- The stdclsdv package is no longer required
