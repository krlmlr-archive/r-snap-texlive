  pdfcomment.sty -- INSTALL
=============================

All the files ending with .sty  have to be installed where TeX can 
find them. Please refer to your TeX distribution's manual for how
to install additional packages.

According to the TeX Directory Standard (TDS), the files should be
installed in your local texmf/ tree as follows:

-- *.sty -> localtexmf/tex/latex/pdfcomment/
-- *.pdf -> localtexmf/doc/latex/pdfcomment/
-- *.tex -> localtexmf/doc/latex/pdfcomment/

Don't forget to update your FNDB (Filename database). (see: manual)
