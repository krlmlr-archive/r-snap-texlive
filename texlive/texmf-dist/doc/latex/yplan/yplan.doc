This is the documentation for the Perl program yplan.
Yplan is a vertical-type daily planner,
showing all the days of a year on two A4 pages.

The file yplan, in CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/other/yplan/, is a Perl
program which generates LaTeX2e code to print, for any chosen year
from 1999 onward, a vertical-type daily planner (ie months along the
top, days downwards), with each 6-month period fitting onto a single
A4 sheet.  They will also fit onto USA standard size paper.  The
vertical size can be adjusted by changing \datestrut.  The generated
files are really just large tables, and so you may wish to extract
just the tables and modify them for your own use.

Dick Nickalls was motivated to design this year-planner as his A4
diary did not have good year-planner at the end.
Harald Harders added support for several languages besides English,
in the form of a LaTeX2e package yplan.sty.
Hand-edited LaTeX files for 1999 and 2000 were issued, called
yplan99a.tex, etc.  (These are not made obsolete by the new program;
they remain useful, for instance to those who don't have a Perl
interpreter.)
John Palmer then wrote the general Perl program which makes a LaTeX
file for any chosen year.  In doing so he incorporated Harald's
alternative language support into the Perl code, in such a way that
the yplan.sty file is no longer needed, and added the Swedish and
Latin languages.

The Perl code has been tested with perl 5.004 and 5.005, but should
run with many earlier versions of Perl.  It has been used successfully
on both Linux and MS-DOS.  The output from yplan runs nicely on
LaTeX2e, and may have to be adjusted very slightly to run on LaTeX
2.09.

Here are the instructions for running yplan:

The normal usage is
   yplan LANGUAGE LETTERCASE PAGE YEAR >FILE.tex
where:
   LANGUAGE is one of: english, german, french, italian, spanish,
   portuguese, swedish, latin.  If LANGUAGE is omitted, english is
   assumed.
   LETTERCASE is one of: uppercase, lowercase.  This controls the
   setting of month-names.  If LETTERCASE is omitted, uppercase is
   assumed.
   PAGE is one of: p1, p2.  This selects the first or second six
   months of the chosen YEAR; if PAGE is omitted, both pages are
   printed.
   YEAR must be written with four digits.  YEAR may NOT be omitted.
   FILE.tex is where to put the generated LaTeX code.  (The output of
   the program must be redirected to some file that can be processed
   by LaTeX.)

The following variants on this syntax are accepted:
   Arguments wholly or partly in uppercase are translated to
   lowercase.
   Arguments are recognised even if given in the wrong order.
   You may write any argument with - or / at the start, and, in
   general, obvious extra characters at start and end of arguments
   are ignored.

Fatal errors:
   The program will stop with an error-message in these cases:
   if no YEAR is specified (in this case it prints a message showing
      the correct way to use the program);
   if YEAR < 1999 (years before 1999 are not provided for);
   if LANGUAGE is specified but is not one of the set given above.
