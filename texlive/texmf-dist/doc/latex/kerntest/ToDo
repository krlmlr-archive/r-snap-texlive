Bugs, new features, ...
=======================

- Avoid overfull \hboxes
- Allow more powerful operations on single glyphs?
- Increase speed of compilation (yet, no optimization has been done).
- On demand, copy predefined kerning data from one glyph of a glyph
  class to all members and complain about inconsistent kernings in the
  original font.
