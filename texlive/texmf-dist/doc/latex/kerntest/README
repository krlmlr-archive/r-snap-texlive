kerntest.cls
============

Print tables and generate mtx files that help to adjust kernings


This class makes it easy to generate tables that show many different
kerning pairs of an arbitrary font, usable by LaTeX.
It shows the kerning values that are used by the the font by default.

In addition, this class enables the user to alternate the kernings
and to observe the results.
Kerning pairs can be defined for groups of similar glyphs at once.
Automatically, an mtx file is generated that can be loaded by
fontinst to introduce the user-made kernings into the virtual font
for LaTeX.

The current version is really slow! Please be patient.
