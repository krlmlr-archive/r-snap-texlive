floatrow 0.3b
Modifying the layout of floats.

      The floatrow package provides many ways  to customize layouts of
      floating environments  and has code cooperation with caption 3.x
      package.     Package offers possibilities  to put floats side by
      side, to put caption beside float.   The floatrow settings could
      be expanded to the floats created by packages rotating, wrapfig,
      subfig (in the case of rows of subfloats), and longtable.
