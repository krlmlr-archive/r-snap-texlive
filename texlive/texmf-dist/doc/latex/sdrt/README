This is the file README for sdrt.sty.  You'll find complete documentation in sdrt-doc.pdf

This package is designed to help authors typesetting 
papers related to Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) 
and formal semantics in general. Macros are provided to 
draw the usual boxes, trees, and (hopefully) all the symbols
of that theory, whose commands are easy to remember and
avoid endless search through catalogues of math symbols.

It requires xyling.sty (already available on some distributions 
or downloadable through CTAN) to draw trees and thus xypic.sty.

Licensing of this package is covered by LPPL.

Any reaction is welcome: zappathustra@free.fr
