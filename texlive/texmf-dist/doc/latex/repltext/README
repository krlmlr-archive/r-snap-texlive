Description
===========

The repltext packages exposes to LaTeX a relatively obscure PDF
feature: replacement text.  When replacement text is specified for a
piece of text, it is the replacement text, not the typeset text that
is copied and pasted.


Installation
============

To build the repltext package, simply run "latex repltext.ins" then
move the generated repltext.sty file into a directory searched by
LaTeX (e.g., <something>/texmf-local/tex/latex/repltext/).  Refresh
the filename database, if necessary, using mktexlsr or a similar tool.
