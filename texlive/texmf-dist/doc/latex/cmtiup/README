       Upright Digits and Punctuation in Computer Modern Italic
			     Version 1.3a
			      2010/11/19


This package provides a set of modified Computer Modern Italic fonts:
the digits and punctuation are upright.  This helps typesetting
mathematical texts, where slanted digits in text look disturbing near
upright digits in math.

The package provides a set of virtual fonts combining Computer Modern
Italic and Computer Modern Roman.  Metafont fonts are also included.
The LaTeX style cmtiup.sty switches italic fonts to the modified ones.
