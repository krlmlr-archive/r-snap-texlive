crop.sty
========

provides different forms of cropmarks for
trimming paper stacks, for camera alignment and
for visualizing the page dimensions.
There are options for centering the page with
respect to some physical paper size, for marking
the vertical and horizontal middle axis, for
mounting pages on a physical sheet, for
reflecting and inverting the whole document or
printing it upside-down, and for suppressing
either text or graphics output.

Extracting the package & processing the documentation
=====================================================

on Unix/Linux just run "make" to get the style file and the documentation;
else generate the driver crop.ins (if you don't already have it):

    $ latex crop.dtx

Now generate the style file:

    $ tex crop.ins

And finally to produce the documentation run LaTeX three times:

    $ latex crop.dtx
