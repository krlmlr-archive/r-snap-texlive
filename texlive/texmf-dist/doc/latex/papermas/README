1 INTRODUCTION
==============

This package allows to compute the mass of a printed version of a
document, useful e.g. when sending it by mail to determine the postage.

Warning/Disclaimer: The mass of (printer's) ink has to be added and that
of envelope, address sticker, stamps,... Thus this is only an estimation
without guarantee - do not sue me, if you have got to pay excess postage!

2 DOWNLOAD
==========

`papermas' is available on CTAN:
  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/papermas/

Also a ZIP file is provided that contains the files, already
sorted in a TDS tree:
  CTAN:install/macros/latex/contrib/papermas.tds.zip

`CTAN:' means one of the `Comprehensive TeX Archive Network'
nodes or one of its mirrors. This is explained in
  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=archives

The CTAN stuff will be mirrored automatically from the
ftp server, so
  ftp://ftp.tug.org/pub/tex/papermas/
corresponds to
  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/papermas/


3 INSTALLATION
==============

Installation with ZIP file in TDS format
----------------------------------------
The ZIP file `papermas.tds.zip' contains the files sorted
in a TDS tree. Thus you can directly unpack the ZIP file
inside a TDS tree.
(See CTAN:tds.zip for an explanation of TDS.)
Example:
  cd /...somewhere.../texmf
  unzip /...downloadpath.../papermas.tds.zip
Do not forget to refresh the file name database of this
TDS tree.
Example:
  texhash /...somewhere.../texmf

Manual installation
-------------------
a) Download the papermas files from CTAN or the TUG server.
   If necessary, unpack them.
b) Generate the package and driver files:
     tex papermas.ins
c) Install the file `*.sty' in your TDS tree:
     cp *.sty TDS:tex/latex/papermas/
   Replace `TDS:' by the prefix of your TDS tree
   (texmf directory).
d) Copy the documentation files to
   "TDS:doc/latex/papermas/":
   README, papermas.pdf, papermas-example.tex,
   papermas-example.pdf.
e) Update the databases if necessary, e.g. for teTeX:
     mktexlsr .../texmf


4 ADDITIONAL PACKAGES
=====================

Depending on the driver and option settings, papermas loads
other packages:
* kvoptions.sty:
    CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/kvoptions.dtx
* intcalc.sty:
    CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/intcalc.dtx
* pageslts.sty:
    CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/pageslts/pageslts.dtx
which again load other packages
(see the result of the \listfiles command in the log-file
 of the example).


5 PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY
=======================

papermas should be loaded AFTER package pageslts.

7 BUG REPORTS
==============

A bug report should contain:
* Comprehensive problem description. This includes error or
  warning messages.
  * \errorcontextlines=\maxdimen can be added in the
    TeX code to get more information in TeX error messages.
* Minimal test file that shows the problem, but does not
  contain any unnecessary packages and code.
* Used drivers/programs.
* Version information about used packages and programs.
  * If you are using LaTeX, then add "\listfiles". Then
    a list of version information is printed at the end
    of the LaTeX run.
* Please no other files than the minimal test file.
  The other files .log, .dvi, .ps, .pdf are seldom
  necessary, so send them only on request.
* Please .zip or .tar.gz your file(s) before sending them!

8 KNOWN PROBLEMS
=================

TeX 2011/06/27 has changed \enddocument and
thus broken the \AtVeryVeryEnd command/hooking
of atveryend package as of 2011/04/23, v1.7.
Until it is fixed, \AtEndAfterFileList is used.
