longfigure --- A LaTeX package providing a table-like environment
               that can display a stream of figures as a single
               figure that can be broken by \TeX's
               standard page-breaking algorithm.

               Nearly identical to David Carlisle's |longtable| package,
               but with some obvious changes to use figures instead of
               tables. All credit goes to David Carlisle; this package
               represents small changes to his code and logic.
