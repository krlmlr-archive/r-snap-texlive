Abstract

	labbook.cls - a document class that produces an index of sectioning
  commands 

  This class is designed to typeset laboratory journals that contain
  chronologically ordered records about experiments. From the
  sectioning commands, an experiment index is generated. The class
  is based on the KOMA-Script class scrbook.cls.

To produce the class and example files

	latex labbook.ins


To produce the documentation 

  (pdf)latex labbook.dtx

	To produce an index for the documentation:

    makeindex -s gind.ist labbook

  To produce a change history for the documentation:
  
    makeindex -s gglo.ist -o labbook.gls labbook.glo

Users of Emacs and AUCTeX might want to copy the file labbook.el to
a place where AUCTeX finds its style files.
