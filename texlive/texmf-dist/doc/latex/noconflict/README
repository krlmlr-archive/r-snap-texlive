This package resolves macro name conflict among packages with concise

A macro name can be defined by many packages. In LaTeX, macro name need 
to be unique for a document and thus using the packages with same macro 
name causes conflict among them. In order to avoid macro name conflict 
this package defines several commands to save, restore and rename macros 
defined by other packages.

PACKAGE COMMANDS
================

\prefix{<prefix added to the macro name>}
\save{<prefix added to the macro name>}
     {<comma separated list of macro name>}
\save*{<comma separated list of macro name>}
\restore{<prefix added to the macro name>}
\restore*
\reinstate{<prefix added to the macro name>}
          {<comma separated partial list of macro name>}
\rename{<old name>}{<new name>}


USAGE EXAMPLE
=============

If package A, B and C define three macro names X, Y and Z. To avoid macro 
name conflict:

\usepackage{noconflict}
\usepackage{A}
\prefix{First} is optional
\save{X,Y,Z}

\usepackage{B}
\save{Second}{X,Y,Z}
The above line can also be written as: \prefix{Second} and \save*{X,Y,Z}

\usepackage{C}
\save{Third}{X,Y,Z}

Now macro X, Y and Z of
Package A: \FirstX, \FirstY, \FirstZ
Package B: \SecondX, \SecondY, \SecondZ
Package C: \ThirdX, \ThirdY, \ThirdZ

\restore{First}
Macros \FirstX, \FirstY and \FirstZ become \X, \Y and \Z
\restore{Second}
The above line can also be written as: \prefix{Second} and \restore*
The above line can also be written as: \reinstate{Second}{X,Y,Z}
Macros \SecondX, \SecondY and \SecondZ become \X, \Y and \Z
\restore{Third}
Macros \ThirdX, \ThirdY and \ThirdZ become \X, \Y and \Z
\rename{X}{CofX}
Macro \X becomes \CofX
