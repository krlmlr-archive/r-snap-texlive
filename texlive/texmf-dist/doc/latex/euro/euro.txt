euro.sty
========

This package converts arbitrary national currency amounts
using the Euro as base unit, and typesets monetary amounts
in almost any desired way. Write e.g. \ATS{17.6} to get
something like `17,60 \"oS  (1,28 Euro)' automatically.
Conversion rates for the so-called Euro-zone countries
are already built-in. Further rates can be added easily.

Extracting the package & processing the documentation
=====================================================

on Unix/Linux just run "make" to get the style file and the documentation;
else generate the driver euro.ins (if you don't already have it):

    $ latex euro.dtx

Now generate the style file:

    $ tex euro.ins

And finally to produce the documentation run LaTeX three times:

    $ latex euro.dtx



This package needs the fp-package!
