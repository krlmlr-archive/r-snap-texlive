The kantlipsum package spits out sentences in Kantian style provided
by the "Kant generator for Python" by Mark Pilgrim, described in the
book "Dive into Python".

This is version 0.6 of the package

Changes from earlier version:

The `index' option for writing index entries has been added; the
code has been polished.
