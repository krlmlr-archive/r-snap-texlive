    The isorot package is for rotation of document elements. It is a 
combination of the lscape package and an extension of the rotating package.
It is designed for use with the iso class but can be used with any 
`normal' class. The package requires the lscape and graphicx packages 
to be available.

    The distribution is released under the LPPL and consists of the 
following files:
README (this file)
isorot.ins
isorot.dtx
rotman.tex
rotman.pdf

    To install the package:
o run: latex isorot.ins (which will generate isorot.sty)
o Either latex rotman.tex or print rotman.pdf for the User Manual
o Move isorot.sty to a location where LaTeX will find it.
o For a copy of the commented code:
  o run: latex isorot.dtx
  o run: makeindex -s gind.ist isorot
  o run: latex isorot.dtx
  o Print isorot.dvi for a hardcopy of the commented code
