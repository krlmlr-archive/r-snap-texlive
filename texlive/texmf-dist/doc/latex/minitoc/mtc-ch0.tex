That's right, folks -- we're close to the release of Firefox and
Thunderbird~1.0 and, just like our last 1.0~release, we want to organize
worldwide parties to celebrate.

Thanks to Dominik 'Aeneas' Schnitzer, we have an all-new and improved
Mozilla Party Webtool~2.0. You can create your own party, or sign up for
one already in progress -- and, in an improvement on Webtool~1.0,
organizers can now edit and update party details. The tool allows you to
organize a celebration in any of 243~countries, principalities,
dominions and islands around the world. Never let it be said that we do
things by halves around here.
