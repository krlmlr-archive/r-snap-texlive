maybemath LaTeX style, by Andy Buckley <andy@insectnation.org>
--------------------------------------------------------------

maybemath provides LaTeX macros for making math bold, upright, italic
or sans-serif according to context.

The \maybebm and \maybeit macros can be used in math expressions to make 
the arguments typeset as bold or italic respectively if the surrounding 
context is appropriate. They are useful for writing user macros for use 
in general contexts.

\maybebm is especially appropriate when section titles contain math 
expressions, since the title will appear bold but the header and table 
of contents usually replicate the title in normal width.

\maybeit performs a similar role to \mathrm{} but the math expression will 
be italicised if the surrounding text is. \maybeitsubscript is provided to 
shift subscripts to the left if the expression is italicised.

\maybesf makes the argument typeset with \mathsf{} if the surrounding text
context is sans-serif. Note that there is no sans-serif italic math font, 
so this command is not compatible with any italic-forcing commands.

A convenience macro, \maybebmsf is available for handling boldness and
sans-serif issues at the same time, as these are probably the most frequent
problematic environments. Other combined handling is possible with nested 
use of the above commands.

Thanks to Viet-Trung Luu on comp.text.tex for providing the first steps
to solving this problem.
