Readme File for the mathbbol package by J"org Knappen
(c) Copyleft 1995--1999 J"org Knappen under the GNU licence version 2

   The mathbbol package exploits the bbold-fonts and the stmaryrd-fonts
designed by Alan Jeffrey and Jeremy Gibbons. Many people prefer these fonts 
over the AMS \mathbb, because the symbols for the real numbers, complex 
numbers, etc. look just right. But the Jeffrey fonts contain more: 
blackbord bold digits, lower case letters, greek letters and even punctuation.

   To use this package, just write
\usepackage[cspex,bbgreekl]{mathbbol}
in the preamble of the document. Note that this package has two options.

-- cspex activates the special extension font, allowing you to say
   $\left\Lbrack ... \right\Rbrack$ to get double lined extensible 
   brackets.

   With Version 2 of the package, the extensions are taken from the
   stmaryrd fonts instead of cspex, since the latter fonts are withdrawn
   by their author.

-- bbgreekl activates commands for the lower case blackbord bold greek, 
   which are just \bbalpha ... \bbomega.

Without options, the following commands are defined:

o \mathbb{A}  to produce blackbord bold A. All upper and lowercase latin 
  letters are accessible this way. It overwrites AMS-LaTeX's 
  \mathbb (and can be overwritten if you load amsfonts after mathbbol)
o \mathbb{0}  to produce the blackbord bold digit 0. All digits are
  accessible this way
o \mathbb{\Lambda} to produce a blackbord bold Lambda. All uppercase greek
  letters are accessible this way. 
o \Langle, \Lbrack, \Lparen to produce blackbord bold <, [, (
o \Rangle, \Rbrack, \Rparen right counterparts of the above
o \Eins to produce blackbord bold digit 1.

   There are more symbols in the font, which aren't defined, because they
are never (really?) needed.

   Please find the bbold and stmary fonts on your nearest CTAN archive in 
directory tex-archive/fonts/bbold.

   This package assumes that the Sauter-tools, to be found in 
tex-archive/fonts/cm/sauter, are used to generate the fonts at true sizes.

   This package contains 4 files, namely

   mathbbol.rme   This readme file
   mathbbol.sty   The package file
   ubbold.fd      Font definition file for the bbold fonts
   ustmary.fd     Font definition file for the stmaryrd fonts

   Conflicts with other packages:

If amsfonts is loaded together with mathbbol, the later package decides
the shape of the \mathbb letters.

If amsmath is loaded, \mathbb{<Capital greek letter>} does not work any
more. To work around, save the original definitions of \Gamma etc. before
loading amsmath and restore them afterwards:
\let\savedGamma\Gamma
\usepackage{amsmath}
\let\Gamma\savedGamma
