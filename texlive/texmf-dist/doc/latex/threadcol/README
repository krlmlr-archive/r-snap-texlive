Description
===========

The threadcol package combines a document's columns into a PDF
"article thread".  PDF readers that support this mechanism (probably
just Adobe Acrobat/Reader) can be instructed to scroll automatically
from column to column, which facilitates on-screen reading of
two-column documents.

Even for single-column documents, threadcol supports the creation of
multiple article threads, which help organize discontiguous but
logically related regions of text into a form that the user can scroll
through as if its contents were contiguous.


Installation
============

There's nothing special about building threadcol.  To create
threadcol.sty simply run "tex threadcol.ins".  Install threadcol.sty
somewhere where LaTeX can find it.  See
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=instpackages for
general information about installing packages.
