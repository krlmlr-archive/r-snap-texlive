The package defines auxiliary TikZ styles useful for
overlaying pictures' elements in Beamer.

The TikZ styles are grouped in a library, overlay-beamer-styles
which is automatically called by the aobs-tikz package. Users
can either load only aobs-tikz or the library; the latter method
necessitates TikZ manual load.
