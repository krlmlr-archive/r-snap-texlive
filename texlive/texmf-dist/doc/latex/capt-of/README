This directory provides a single LaTeX package: capt-of.sty

The package allows the user to produce captions in the ordinary text
of a document.  Such captions are identical to those used in floats
(except that they're not in a float...).

The bundle is distributed under the lppl, and is Copyright (c) Robin
