rotpages.sty R3.0
Copyright 2002 Sergio Callegari

The rotpages.sty package for latex 2e permits to format documents
where small sets of pages are rotated by 180 degrees and rearranged,
so that they can be read by turning the printed copy upside-down.  It
was primarly meant for collecting exercises and solutions: the package
permits to print the exercise text normally and the solutions
rotated. The idea is to make it a bit harder for the students to
unintentionally read the solutions before trying to solve the
exercises autonomously. Other uses are obviously possible.

This is release 3.0 of the package, with many enhancements over release 1.0.
Release 2.0 has never been distributed due to some problems it had.
Note that release 3.0 is *not* compatible with version 1.0, however
documents written for version 1.0 can be easily converted to take
advantage of the features of version 3.0.

The package may be distributed and/or modified under the
conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.2
of this license or (at your option) any later version.
The latest version of this license is in
   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
and version 1.2 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX 
version 1999/12/01 or later.
