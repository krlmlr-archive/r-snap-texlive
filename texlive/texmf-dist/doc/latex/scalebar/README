THE SCALEBAR PACKAGE

Abstract

This package creates scalebars for maps, diagrams or photos. 
It was designed for use with cave maps but can be used for 
anything from showing a scalebar in kilometers for topographic 
maps to a scalebar in micrometers for an electron microscope image.

To produce the style file run:
    latex scalebar.ins
    This will produce scalebar.sty which needs to be copied to 
    a suitable directory under your local texmf directory.
    
To produce the documentation run:
    latex scalebar.dtx
    This will produce scalebar.dvi documentation.

To produce an index for the documentation:
    makeindex -s gind.ist scalebar
    latex scalebar.dtx

To produce a change history for the documentation:
    makeindex -s gglo.ist -o scalebar.gls scalebar.glo
    latex scalebar.dtx

Files supplied in this package:
    scalebar.ins   Batch file, run through LaTeX
    scalebar.dtx   Docstrip archive, run through LaTeX.
    scalebar_examples.pdf
                   Lots of examples on how to use the macro 
		   already formatted for you in PDF format.
    scalebar_examples.tex   
                   LaTeX source for the examples.
