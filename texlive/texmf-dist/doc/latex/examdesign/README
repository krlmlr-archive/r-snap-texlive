This bundle provides a class examdesign for making exams.  

The class provides several features useful for designing tests
or question sets:

* it allows for explicit markup of questions and answers;

* the class will, at the user's request, automatically generate
answer keys;

* multiple versions of the same test can be generated
automatically, with the ordering of questions within each section
randomly permuted so as to minimize cheating;

* the generated answer keys can be constructed either with or
without the questions included;

* environments are provided to assist in constructing the most
common types of test question: matching, true/false,
multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short answer/essay
questions.
