Put the materials in your favorite spot.  For instance, on Unix-like 
system a good spot may be /var/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/examdesign/ .

In that directory run 
  latex examdesign.ins
(and then you might have to copy the created file examdesign.cls into an area 
where LaTeX2e can find it).  Don't forget to run "texhash" (if you are using
a menu-ed environment you may need to find a menu item like "Rebuild 
the TeX database").

Make your new document like this. 

\documentclass[10pt]{examdesign}
\begin{document}
  :
\end{document}

Use the example files as a start.
