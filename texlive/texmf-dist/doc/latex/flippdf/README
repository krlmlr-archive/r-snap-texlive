The "flippdf" package extends LaTeX making it possible to typeset a
"mirrored" version of the document. This is sometimes required by
publishers who want "camera-ready" documents to be printable on
transparent films, so that one reads the pages correctly by looking
through the film (i.e., with the unprinted side of the film towards
his eyes. This package requires "everypage" by the same author and
works with pdfLaTeX only.
