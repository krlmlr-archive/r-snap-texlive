For most purposes, the features of \newcommand suffice. Nonetheless,
\newcommand lacks some interesting features like the ability to make

e-TEX. This--surprisingly small--package makes possible to pass an
optional argument \newcommand so that is becomes possible to use the
\global and \protected prefixes.
