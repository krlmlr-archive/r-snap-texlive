\picas         - Print dimen converted to the nearest whole pica.

This package was written by Michael Downes, who passed away in 2003.  He
released it without a license, which is considered nonfree nowadays.  In
October 2012, his heirs (his children Zoe, Elizabeth, and Mia Downes)
have all agreed to re-releasing his work under any version of the LaTeX
Public Project License.  Therefore, the package is now released under
the LPPL, version 1 or (at your option) any later version.

The only change in this release is to the license (and typos).
The actual code is the same as Michael's last release.
