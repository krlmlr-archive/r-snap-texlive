* Warning!
==========
As of version 2.2.1, FiNK has been deprecated and is not maintained anymore.
People interested in FiNK's functionality are invited to use a package named
currfile instead.


* Description
=============

This package looks over your shoulder and keeps track of files \input'ed (the
LaTeX way) or \include'ed in your document. You then have a permanent access
to the directory, name and extension of the file currently being processed
through several macros. FiNK also comes with support for AUC-TeX.

* Installation
==============

If you are building FiNK from the tarball you need to execute the following
steps in order to extract the necessary files:

[pdf]latex fink.ins -> will create the style file fink.sty
[pdf]latex fink.dtx -> (twice) will create the documentation files fink.pdf or
                       fink.dvi. Note that fink.pdf is already part of the
                       distribution.

After that, you need to install the generated documentation and style file to
a location where LaTeX can find them. For a TDS-compliant layout, the
following locations are suggested:

[TEXMF]/tex/latex/fink/fink.sty
[TEXMF]/doc/latex/fink/fink.[pdf|dvi]

If you're an AUC-TeX user, you may also install the file 'fink.el' in a
suitable AUC-TeX style directory.


	Have fun!
