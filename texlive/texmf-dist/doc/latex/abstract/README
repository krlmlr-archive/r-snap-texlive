The ABSTRACT package

    The abstract package gives you control over the typesetting of the
abstract environment, and in particular provides for a one column abstract
in a two column paper. 

    Will Robertson is now maintaining this package. Please contact him
in preference to the original author, Peter Wilson, for feature requests
and bug reports.
