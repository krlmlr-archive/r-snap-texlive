tabfigures - Using tabular figures with LaTeX
=============================================

The tabfigures package is a collection of patches for using
tabular figures in some LaTeX environments where numbers should
line up vertically such as the table of contents and enumerations.

Usage
-----

To use this package, include

    \usepackage[<options>]{tabfigures}

in the preamble of your LaTeX document. See the PDF documentation for
the available options and other details.

Installation
------------

1. Run `latex tabfigures.ins` to generate the LaTeX package.

2. Create the following directories in a local texmf tree:

   - doc/latex/tabfigures
   - tex/latex/tabfigures

3. Copy all necessary files into the texmf tree:

   - tabfigures.pdf goes to doc/latex/tabfigures
   - tabfigures.sty goes to tex/latex/tabfigures

4. Afterwards, you may need to regenerate the file database:

    texhash
