This is the README file for the pgfkeyx package.

VERSION

Version 0.0.1, April 2012.

SUMMARY

The pgfkeyx package provides extensions and robustness to the
pgfkeys package. In particular, it can deal with active comma,
equality sign, and slash in key parsing. It also introduces new
handlers.

It requires pgfkeys package to be loaded first. This restriction
may be lifted in the future, if pgfkeyx became independent of
pgfkeys package.

This is currently a package for LaTeX users only. However, we've 
started generating platform-independent code in this package, as 
required by pgf/tikz team.
