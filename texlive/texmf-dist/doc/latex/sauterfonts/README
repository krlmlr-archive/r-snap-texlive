These files provide access to many fonts in Sauter's collection (which became
Knappen's and Holin's collection). Mainly the slitex and cyrillic fonts are
missing.

To extract the files type
	latex sauterfonts.ins
(tex, virtex or initex can be used instead). To format the sparse documentation
type
	latex sauterfonts.fdd
and read about unpacking options, usage etc. instead of the files themselves.
