LaTeX Package: Locality 2010/06/29 v0.1
----------------------------------------
Various macros for keeping things local

Copyright (C) 2010
by Jason Gross <JasonGross9+locality@gmail.com>

Abstract:
  This package provides various macros to keep changes local to the current 
  group.  This allows one to (re)define helper macros without worrying about
  accidentally changing the functionality of another package's or the user's
  definitions.  Additionally, it allows recursive macros to have some
  definitions persist between calls, and others be local.

CTAN: macros/latex/contrib/locality

Recent changes:
 [Release 0.2]
  * Switched the order of tests in \manyaftergroup, eliminating an infinite loop.
  * Added \DeclareNonlocal*s, \pushvalues, \popvalues, \pushvalue, \popvalue, and a few others.
  * Fixed \DeclareNonlocal* to work with \aftergroup.
  * Added requirement for etoolbox, so that patching takes place at the end of the preamble.
 [Release 0.1]
  * Initial release.  Some macros untested.
