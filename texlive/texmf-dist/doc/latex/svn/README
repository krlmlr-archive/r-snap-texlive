This is the svn.sty distribution

*About
The svn package lets you typeset (in LaTeX) the value of Subversion
keywords.  It is approximately an equivalent to the rcs package, but
for Subversion rather than CVS.

Information about Subversion (a replacement for CVS) is available from
<http://subversion.tigris.org/>

*Contents
The svn.sty distribution consists of the files:
 README  (this file)
 svn.pdf (precompiled documentation)
 svn.dtx
 svn.ins
 Makefile

from which svn.{sty,dvi,pdf,ps} may be generated.

*Installation
**With make
On systems with make (e.g., Linux) run

 make sty

The documentation is included in pdf format.  To regenerate the
documentation run

 make <format>

replacing <format> with dvi, pdf or ps, depending on the format you'd
like the documentation in.

The above will create some .log and .aux (etc) files, to remove these say
 make clean

For more options see the comments at the start of Makefile.
Then follow the "Finishing the installation" instructions.

**Without make
To make do without make (eg windoze) run:

 latex svn.ins

To generate the documentation in dvi format do:

 latex svn.dtx
 makeindex -s gind.ist -o svn.ind svn.idx
 latex svn.dtx

**Finishing the installation
Whether you used make or not, you need to move the generated file
svn.sty into a directory searched by TeX.

For information on the use of svn.sty read svn.pdf.

*Acknowledgements
svn is modelled on the functionality of the rcs package (written by
Joachim Schrod with minor modification by Jeffrey Goldberg), and the
structure of the .dtx/.ins is that described in the dtxtut package (by
Scott Pakin).
