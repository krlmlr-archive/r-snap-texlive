This is version 0.12d of the skrapport document class, intended for simple
reports submitted by the author at Chalmers University of Technology.

The following files are enclosed.

  README        - This file
  Makefile      - GNU Makefile for making the package and documentation
  skrapport.tex - LaTeX source code of the class and documentation
  skrapport.pdf - PDF version of the documentation

Installation notes:
The easiest way to install this package, assuming you have obtained the
source code from Github or CTAN, is to simply run `make install`. This
will generate package code and documentation, install it into TEXMFHOME
and run `mktexlsr`. If you wish to compile the package but not install
it, run `make all` instead. If you insist on doing it manually, remember
that you must use `pdflatex` (not `tex` or `latex`).
