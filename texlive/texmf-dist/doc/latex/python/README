This package enables you to embed Python code (www.python.org) in LaTeX and insert the output into your LaTeX document.

In you LaTeX document insert:

\usepackage{python}
...
\begin{python}[optional.py]
print("42")
\end{python}

The file optional.py is included together with the code between \begin{python} and \end{python}. Hence, you can extract common code to a shared file.

Compile the document with the shell escape option and of course Python installed:

% latex -shell-escape document.tex

or insert/change "shell_escape = t" in your texmf.cnf

If you have any comments, suggestions, or patches please email them to me.
