This is a package meant to help a LaTeX-writer to keep track all the defined
labels by typesetting a complete list of labels whereever the author requests
it. Keep in mind, that you might need to have additional LaTeX runs to get the
references right.

This package is based on an answer David Carlisle gave on tex.stackexchange.com
in the thread [List of all labels with hyperlinks][1].
