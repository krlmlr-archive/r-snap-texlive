1 INTRODUCTION
==============

This LaTeX package allows to override existing labels,
especially automatically generated ones.

Note: The main code of this package was invented by
Ulrich Diez (eu_angelion AT web DOT de) and first published in the
comp.text.tex newsgroup at Sun, 20 Apr 2008 16:39:26 +0200, with subject:
Re: How to undefine/overwrite a label? (see e.g.
http://groups.google.de/group/comp.text.tex/msg/af6cfe93917097da?dmode=source).
While Ulrich Diez neither wanted to create a package himself yet
nor have one published under his name, he granted the
publication of his code. Therefore: Thanks!
I (H.-Martin Münch) submitted this package to CTAN
(after some updates of the documentation, mainly layout,
 typos and such things.)

2 DOWNLOAD
==========

`undolabl' is available on CTAN:
  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/undolabl/

Running
tex undolabl.dtx
generates the files
undolabl.ins, undolabl.drv, undolabl.sty,
and undolabl-example.tex.

Also a ZIP file is provided that contains these files,
the manual (undolabl.pdf), the compiled example
(undolabl-example.pdf), and this README, already
sorted in a TDS tree:
  CTAN:install/macros/latex/contrib/undolabl.tds.zip

`CTAN:' means one of the `Comprehensive TeX Archive Network'
nodes or one of its mirrors. This is explained in
  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=archives

The CTAN stuff will be mirrored automatically from the
ftp server, so
  ftp://ftp.tug.org/pub/tex/undolabl/
corresponds to
  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/undolabl/


3 INSTALLATION
==============

Installation with ZIP file in TDS format
----------------------------------------
The ZIP file `undolabl.tds.zip' contains the files
sorted in a TDS tree. Thus you can directly unpack the
ZIP file inside a TDS tree.
(See CTAN:tds.zip for an explanation of TDS.)
Example:
  cd /...somewhere.../texmf
  unzip /...downloadpath.../undolabl.tds.zip
Do not forget to refresh the file name database of this
TDS tree.
Example:
  texhash /...somewhere.../texmf

Manual installation
-------------------
a) Download the undolabl files from CTAN.
   If necessary, unpack them.
b) Generate the package and driver files:
     tex undolabl.dtx
c) Install the file `*.sty' in your TDS tree:
     cp *.sty TDS:tex/latex/undolabl/
   Replace `TDS:' by the prefix of your TDS tree
   (texmf directory).
d) Create the documentation (if necessary), e.g.
     pdflatex undolabl.dtx
     makeindex -s gind.ist undolabl.idx
     pdflatex undolabl.dtx
     makeindex -s gind.ist undolabl.idx
     pdflatex undolabl.dtx
e) Update the databases if necessary, e.g. for teTeX:
     mktexlsr .../texmf
f) Create the undolabl-example.pdf (if necessary), e.g.
     pdflatex undolabl-example.tex
     pdflatex undolabl-example.tex
     pdflatex undolabl-example.tex
g) Copy the documentation files to
   "TDS:doc/latex/undolabl/":
   README, undolabl.pdf, undolabl-example.tex,
   undolabl-example.pdf.


4 ADDITIONAL PACKAGES
=====================

undolabl itself does not load other packages,
but working with labels usually means using
* hyperref, http://ctan.org/pkg/hyperref
which again loads other packages
(see the result of the \listfiles command in the log-file
 of the example).


5 PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY
=======================

There are no known incompatibilities.


6 AUTHOR/MAINTAINER
=====================

* Author of the original main code: Ulrich Diez (Thanks!)
* Author of the recent package and current maintainer:
   H.-Martin Münch


7 BUG REPORTS
==============

A bug report should contain:
* Comprehensive problem description. This includes error or
  warning messages.
* \errorcontextlines=\maxdimen can be added in the
  TeX code to get more information in TeX error messages.
* Minimal test file that shows the problem, but does not
  contain any unnecessary packages and code.
* Used drivers/programs.
* Version information about used packages and programs.
* If you are using LaTeX, then add "\listfiles". Then
  a list of version information is printed at the end
  of the LaTeX run.
* Please no other files than the minimal test file.
  The other files .log, .dvi, .ps, .pdf are seldom
  necessary, so send them only on request.
* Please .zip or .tar.gz your file(s) before sending them!
