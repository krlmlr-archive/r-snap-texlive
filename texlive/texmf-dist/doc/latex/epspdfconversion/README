epspdfconversion.sty facilitates the use of the epspdf tools (on CTAN in
pub/tex/support) from within PDFLaTeX. EPS graphic files are converted
"on the fly". It is similar to and based on the epstopdf package and
allows to pass several options such as grayscale, prepress, pdfversion
etc. to the epspdf conversion-command. Can also be used to trigger a
conversion of PDF- and PS-files.

New in version 0.61:

* new options pdftopdf and pstopdf. Uses epspdf to do pdf-to-pdf and
  ps-to-pdf conversions. Allows grayscaling, calculation of bounding boxes
  etc for pdf's that already exist an for .ps-files. Disabled by default.

* bugfix for the outdir-option (converted files in subdirectories are
  again saved in those subdirectories) (Thanks to Stefan Pofahl for the
  feedback.) 

* small improvement of the documentation (on the windows
  epspdf.bat file, on epstopdf's option 'outdir') 

* now uses epstopdf's \epstopdfDeclareGraphicsRule
