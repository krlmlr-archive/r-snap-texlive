Description
-----------

LaTeX users sometimes need to ensure that two or more blocks of text
occupy the same horizontal space on the page.  To that end, the
eqparbox package defines \eqparbox, \eqmakebox, \eqframebox, and
\eqsavebox macros and an eqminipage environment.  These work,
respectively, just like the \parbox, \makebox, \framebox, and \savebox
macros and the minipage environment, except that instead of specifying
a width, one specifies a tag.  All boxes with the same tag --
regardless of where they are in the document -- will stretch to fit
the widest box that uses that tag.  This simple, equal-width mechanism
can be used for a variety of alignment purposes, as is evidenced by
the examples in eqparbox's documentation.


Installation
------------

There's nothing special about building eqparbox:

    latex eqparbox.ins     <== Generate eqparbox.sty
    latex eqparbox.dtx     <== Produce the documentation (eqparbox.dvi)
    latex eqparbox.dtx     <== Again, to get labels and eqparboxes right
    makeindex -s gind.ist eqparbox    <== Generate an index
    makeindex -s gglo.ist eqparbox.glo -o eqparbox.gls    <== Generate a change list
    latex eqparbox.dtx     <== Incorporate the index into the document
