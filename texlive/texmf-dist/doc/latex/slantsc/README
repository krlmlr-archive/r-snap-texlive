slantsc.sty
===========

This package enables the use of small capitals in different font
shapes, e.g., slanted or bold slanted for all fonts that provide
appropriate font shapes.
The only prerequisite is that the corresponding |fd| file has to
define the font shapes |scsl| resp.\ |scit| for slanted resp.\
italic small capitals.
