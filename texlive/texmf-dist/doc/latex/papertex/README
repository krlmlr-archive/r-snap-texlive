{Version 1.2b}

This class allows LaTeX users to create a newspaper using LaTeX.
This class was created together with a Perl script in order to create
a publication automatically. paperTeX will help you to create your own
publication with a newspaper style.

This package provides commands to create the front page as well as the
inner pages of a newspaper. There are also various configuration commands
which let the user set up his/her own style.

Important
---------
paperTeX gives its `best results' when using PDFLaTeX. Please, refer to
the documentation to get a better idea of what this class does.

Installation
------------
Download the file papertex.cls and leave it somewhere TeX will find it.

This class requires other LaTeX packages that you might need to download
before compiling your documents.
