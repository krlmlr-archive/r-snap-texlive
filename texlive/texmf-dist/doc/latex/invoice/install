1. Installation and Use

Unpack the archive invoice.zip in some temporary directory.
Copy the files in TEXINPUT to a place where your TeX installation
can find it. Rehash the directory database, if possible (not all
distributions provide this possibility).

Run the file 00README.tex through latex first before doing anything
else! 00README.tex is a document with dynamic contents.

See doc/invoice.tex for an incomplete documentation of the invoice
package.
