The duotenzor package.  Version 1.00


The duotenzor package is a purpose built package for drawing circuits and duotensor 
diagrams within LaTeX documents. It consists of about eighty LaTeX commands that call 
on the TikZ package.  The commands are in duotenzor.sty and the manual is in
duotenzormanual.pdf  

========================================================================================

This package requires that TikZ is installed along with the calc and arrows libraries. 
It also uses the xspace package.  These are standard with most LaTeX installations.
