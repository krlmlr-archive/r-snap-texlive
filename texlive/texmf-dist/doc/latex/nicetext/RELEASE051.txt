nicetext: minimal markup for documentation, text filtering ...
=================================================================
Release 0.51 2012/03/18:

- `fifinddo.sty' v0.51 

    fixes a bug related to support of some lightweight markup 
    in HTML generation by blog.sty. The bug had affected 
    documentation of previous fifinddo and makedoc releases. 
    Anyway ...

- `makedoc.sty' v0.5

    with all the \Make... commands for preprocessing packages 
    for documentation, a `*' avoids inputting mdoccorr.cfg 
    (replacement rules .txt -> .tex) 

- documentation samples `substr' and `arseneau'

    updated to use \MakeCloseDoc* for specific replacement rules
