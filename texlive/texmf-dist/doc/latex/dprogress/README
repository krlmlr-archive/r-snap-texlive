DPROGRESS
=========

Introduction
------------

This package logs latex's progress through the file, making the latex output
more verbose.  This helps to make latex debugging easier, as it is simpler to
find where exactly latex failed.
It outputs the typesetting of section, subsection, subsubsection headers and
the align environment. The align environment is only output if the amsmath
package is loaded.
