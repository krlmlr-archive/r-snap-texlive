The `asypictureB` package allows users to integrate Asymptote code
for producing pictures into LaTeX source code using the shell-escape
functionality. It is an alternative to the `asymptote` package
that comes with Asymptote. The most important advantage of the
asypictureB package is that it provides immediate access to
Asymptote errors by repackaging them as LaTeX errors. It also allows
limited use of TeX macros such as \the\linewidth inside Asymptote code.
