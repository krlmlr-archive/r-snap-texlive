recipecard.dtx v2.0
-------------------------------
The recipecard class typesets recipes into note card sized boxes.
The boxes can then be cut out and glued to note cards.  The class
currently supports 3x5, 4x6, and 5x7 inch note cards.
This distribution includes:

recipecard.cls  v2.0    : Class file

recipecard.pdf          : Documentation

test2.tex               : Sample tex file

text2.pdf               : Sample

The archive includes already generated versions of the above files.

Installation
--------------------------------
Finding a LaTeX installation that has recipecard as part of the
deliverable would be the easiest, but since this is the initial
release of recipecard to the world, one will probably have to
install by hand.

After running LaTeX on the .dtx file or obtaining the files in some
other manner, disperse in the TeX file system as shown below. Square
brackets([]) indicate a new folder will have to be created.  Curly
braces ({}) indicate the actual file to be put in the next higher
folder.  Do not forget: after placing the files as shown, one will
have to refresh the LaTeX distribution's file system to let LaTeX
know the new files are present.
