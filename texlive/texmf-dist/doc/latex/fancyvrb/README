  The `fancyvrb' package provides very sophisticated facilities for reading
and writing verbatim TeX code. Users can perform common tasks like changing
font family and size, numbering lines, framing code examples, colouring text
and conditionally processing text.

  `fancyvrb' was heavily used in the typesetting of the "LaTeX Graphics
Companion", by Michel Goossens, Sebastian Rahtz and Frank Mittelbach, Addison
Wesley, 1997.

  It was presented March 31, 1998 for EuroTeX'98. The original paper is
available on (courtesy "Cahiers GUTenberg"):
http://www.univ-rennes1.fr/pub/GUTenberg/publicationsPS/28-29-girou.ps.gz
The description part of `fancyvrb' is not up to date (it was the content
of the version 2.5) but the additional paragraph about it usage to the
typesetting of the "LaTeX Graphics Companion" provide in depth informations
on some usages of `fancyvrb' not described elsewhere.

  The "contrib" subdirectory contain the `fvrb-ex' package (from Denis Girou),
built above `fancyvrb', which offer some "example" environments showing both
the code in verbatim mode and the result of it normally formatted.

                                   Warning!
                                   --------

  * Support is provided by Denis Girou and Sebastian Rahtz and not by
Timothy Van Zandt. Do not bother him with questions relative to `fancyvrb'!

  * The standard `color' package must be available, with a correct "color.cfg"
file defining the dvi converter that must be used.

  * If the `changebar' package is available on your platform, the changes
since the preceding version will be marked by special gray bars printed
in the margins. But the driver name must be hardcoded in the file.
So, if you have `changebar' and are not using the "dvips" driver, change this
name in the line
             {\ChangeBartrue\usepackage[dvips,rightbars]{changebar}}{}
in fancyvrb.dtx (the other drivers supported by this package are "dvitoln03",
"dvitops" and "emtex").
    If you really need to desactivate this feature (it must not be the case,
as there will be no effect if you haven't `changebar', and, if you have it,
it must work on your platform...) just change the two relevant lines to:
\IfFileExists{changebar.sty}{}{}
