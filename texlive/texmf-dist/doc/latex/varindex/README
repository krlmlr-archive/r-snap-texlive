varindex:
This LaTeX package provides a luxury front-end for the \index command.
For example, it allows to generate multiple \index entries in
almost any form by a single command. Extremely customizable.
Works with all versions of LaTeX and probably most other TeX formats, too.
This package requires the toolbox package at least in version 3.1.
