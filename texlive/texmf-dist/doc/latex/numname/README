This package converts a numerical number to the english spelled out 
name of the number. For example, 1-> one, 2-> two, 12-> twelve. It 
can also convert to the ordinal number, 1->first, 2->second, etc. 

This code was cut and paste from the memoir.cls for use as an 
independent package for projects which prefer not to use the memoir 
class.
