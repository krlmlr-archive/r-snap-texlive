SUMMARY

The keyreader package provides commands for compactly defining and
initializing all types of key (ordinary, command, boolean, and choice).
Keys are automatically set/initialized as soon as they are defined.
It provides a compact and robust interface to the xkeyval package.
The xkeyval package's commands for setting keys are made more robust,
in the sense that outer braces in key values are preserved throughout
parsing and unbalanced conditionals can be parsed as part of a key's
value. In the case of choice keys defined by the command
\krddefinekeys, each admissible value of the key can be associated
with a callback, unlike in the xkeyval package.

The keyreader package has been used as a development platform for the
ltxkeys package because the xkeyval package, on which the keyreader
package is based, has been quite stable for some years (its inherent
shortcomings not withstanding).
