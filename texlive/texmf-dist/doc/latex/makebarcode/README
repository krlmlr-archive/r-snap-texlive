The package contains macros for printing various 2/5 bar codes and Code 39
bar codes. The macros do not use fonts but create the bar codes directly
by vrules. It is therefore possible to vary width to height ratio, ratio
of thin and thick bars. The package is therefore convenient for printing
ITF bar codes as well as bar codes for identification labels for HP
storage media.
