conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.1
of this license or (at your option) any later version.
The latest version of this license is in

and version 1.1 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
version 1999/06/01 or later.

DoX consists of the following files:

- NEWS
- README (this file)
- dox.dtx
- dox.el
- dox.ins


* Description
=============

The doc package provides LaTeX developers with means to describe the usage and
the definition of new commands and environments. However, there is no simple
way to extend this functionality to other items (options or counters for
instance). DoX is designed to circumvent this limitation, and provides some
improvements over the existing functionality as well.

* Installation
==============

If you are building DoX from the tarball you need to execute the following
steps in order to extract the necessary files: 

[pdf]latex dox.ins -> will create the style file dox.sty
[pdf]latex dox.dtx -> (twice) will create the documentation files dox.pdf or
                      dox.dvi. Note that dox.pdf is already part of the
                      distribution. 

After that, you need to install the generated documentation and style file to
a location where LaTeX can find them. For a TDS-compliant layout, the
following locations are suggested:

[TEXMF]/tex/latex/dox/dox.sty 
[TEXMF]/doc/latex/dox/dox.[pdf|dvi] 

If you're an AUC-TeX user, you may also install the file 'dox.el' in a
suitable AUC-TeX style directory.


	Have fun!
