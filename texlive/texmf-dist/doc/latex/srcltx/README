README for the srcltx package

This package provides source special insertion into .dvi files,
allowing to jump from the .dvi file to the .tex source
and vice versa (given a .dvi viewer that supports this, such as YAP
or xdvi(k) >= v.22.38). In addition, it provides hooks for error tracking
from the .log file with the WinEdt shell.

The package was originally written by Aleksander Simonic, the
author of the WinEdt Shell. He kindly permitted me to upload
and maintain a version of this package on CTAN.
