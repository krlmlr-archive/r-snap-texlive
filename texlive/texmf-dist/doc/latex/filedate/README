 Access and Compare LaTeX File Info and Modification Dates

                  (C) Uwe Lueck 2012-11-06

`filedate.sty' provides basic access to the date of a LaTeX 
source file according to its \ProvidesFile, \ProvidesPackage, 
or \ProvidesClass entry -- the "info date" --, as well as to 
its modification date according to \pdffilemoddate if the 
latter is available. Moreover commands are provided to compare 
the "info date" with the modification date, with "today"'s 
date, or with another date that a script accessing modifica-
tion dates such as adhocfilelist.sh may insert, and to choose 
the effect of comparisons (error vs. "notice", reference date 
characterization). Thus updating the "info date" ("date con-
sistency") of a source file may be ensured by a test during 
typesetting from it or by some (shell/TeX) script.
