FIRST UPLOAD 2012-10-17:

`filedate.sty' provides basic access to the date of a LaTeX 
source file according to its \ProvidesFile, \ProvidesPackage, 
or \ProvidesClass entry -- the "info date" --, as well as to 
its modification date according to \pdffilemoddate if the 
latter is available. Moreover commands are provided to compare 
the "info date" with the modification date, with "today"'s 
date, or with another date that a script accessing modifica-
tion dates such as adhocfilelist.sh may insert, and to choose 
the effect of comparisons (error vs. "notice", reference date 
characterization). Thus updating the "info date" ("date con-
sistency") of a source file may be ensured by a test during 
typesetting from it or by some (shell/TeX) script.

In fact the test today admonished me to update the 
documentation source and driver `filedate.tex'. Another 
motivating example of "date inconsistency" was `nicefilelist' 
v0.6 as of 2012-10-11 (see version history) with "info date" 
2012/10/03.

SECOND UPLOAD 2012-10-25: v0.3 has 

 * bug fix with \DatesDiffNotices
 * new \DatesDiffWarnings

THIRD UPLOAD (r0.3a) 2012-11-06:

 * a checking script `fdatechk.tex' is input both by 
   documentation generator and file list generator
   (`filedate.tex', `srcfiles.tex')
   - recommendation for using the package
 * still contains `filedate.sty' v0.3

FOURTH UPLOAD 2012-11-11: v0.4 has 

 * \FileDateAutoChecks after which each \Provides...
   checks info date against its \pdffilemoddate
 * \FileDateAutoChecks* additionally checking dates 
   of main file (hopefully \jobname.tex)
 * \NoFileDateAutoChecks restoring the original behaviour 
   of \Provides..., e.g., for files whose original time 
   stamp has not been preserved in copying/sending

UPLOAD 2013-03-27, v0.41:

 * \FileDateLevelChecks etc., \FileDateUserChecks etc.
   do not check as much automatically as 
   \FileDateAutoChecks does.  E.g., .fd files may be 
   loaded "indirectly" whose modification date is not 
   the \Provides... date, ignore them!
