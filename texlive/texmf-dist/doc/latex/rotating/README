rotating

A package built on the standard LaTeX graphics package, which performs
all the different sorts of rotation one might like, including complete
floating figures/tables and their captions.  The commented source
contains the manual, and there is a set of tests in examples.tex.  The
file examples.tex doubles as a (somewhat disorganised) tutorial for
use of the package.

Install by running TeX on rotating.ins and place `rotating.sty'
"where LaTeX can find it" -- see
  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=inst-wlcf
for guidance on such installation.

Alternatively, a .tds.ins file is available on the CTAN install tree:
install that at the root of your TEXMF-LOCAL tree.
