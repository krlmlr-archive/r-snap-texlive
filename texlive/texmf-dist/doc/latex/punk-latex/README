This is a small package that provides some (poor) LaTeX support for
the punk fonts. The punk fonts are part of many tex installations, and
is found on the TeX Live distribution.

*Installation*

Unpack the archive, and move the files into their proper directories

The files

punk.sty
ot1pnk.fd

TEXMF/tex/latex/punk

punk.pdf

should be placed in
TEXMF/doc/latex/punk

punk.tex is the source of punk.pdf and no installation of it is
required. It can be deleted at will...
