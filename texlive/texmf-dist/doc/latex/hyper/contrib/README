This area is for downloading stuff that authors have
written for adding hypertex capability to other packages 
that are not supported by the hyper package.

They can be included by giving the name <file> for
including <file>.hyp as an optional parameter when
including the hyper package.
If a file does not end with .hyp include it afterwards
instead.
