enumitem-zref  -  Extended References to Items for enumitem package
^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^*=^

enumitem-zref is a companion package for enumitem package.
It makes possible to reference any item in lists formatted by enumitem:
     . enumerated  lists
     . itemize     lists
     . description lists
     . any list defined (or customized) with \newlist / \setlist
       provided by enumitem package.

References can be typeset differently with options/properties and
even arbitrary text.

With hyperref, anchors are added for each item to make hyperlinks
inside the document or even to external documents.

3 schemes are provided to make easy reference names:
    . The `commaref' scheme
    . The `refitem' scheme
    . The `user' scheme (with LaTeX \label command)

The `user' scheme is restrained a bit if hyperref is not loaded.

I hope the \refitem interface is easy to use !         Enjoy ;-)
