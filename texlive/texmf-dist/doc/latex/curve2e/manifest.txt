information

This package is subjectt to the LPPL (LaTeX Project Public Licence( version 1.3 or successive: the full text of the license is contained in any full distribution of the TeX system; in any case you can find it onCTAN (Comprehensive TeX Archive Network).

The package has the LPPL status of author maintained.

Nevertheless this package is an extension to the standard LaTeX package pict2e 
(2011), so that any modification to this file is first of all submitted to the 
authors of pict2e, in case they wanted to incorporate part or all of its contents 
in the official package they maintain.   Therefore  any change must be controlled  
against the parent package pict2e so as to avoid redefining what has already been 
incorporated in the official package. Their e-mails are

If you prefer sending me your modifications, as long as I will maintain this
package, I will forward every (documented) suggestion or modification to the
authors of pict2e.
