Curve2e.sty
version 1.41 
filedate 11 December 2012

This file is an extension of the package pict2e.sty which extends the standard  picture LaTeX environment according to what Leslie Lamport specified in the second edition of the LaTeX manual.

This further extension allows to draw lines and vectors with any non integer slope parameters, to draw dashed lined of any slope, to draw arcs and curved vectors, to draw curves where just the interpolating nodes are specified together with the slopes at the nodes. Some of these features, implemented in this package previous version, have been incorporated in the 2009 version of pict2e; therefore this package has provisions for
avoiding the original commands redefinition.

This version should be fully compatible with pict2e version 0.2x dated 2011/04/05.
