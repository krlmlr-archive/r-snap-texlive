mVersion, v1.0.1 (c) 2011 by Michael Schmeing

The mVersion package is an easy way to keep track of different versions of your document. It provides a counter that can be incremented each time you compile the document. By displaying the counter on each page, (e.g. with the \textsf{hyperref}-package) you can see which of two versions is the newer one.

The version number is considered to consist of two parts which are separated by a dot. The first part is a fixed string that can be set by the user with |setVersion|. The second part is the build number which can be incremented by calling |increaseBuild|. The command |version| prints the complete version number, e.g. 0.1.334 with  0.1 being the fixed version number and 334 the build number.
