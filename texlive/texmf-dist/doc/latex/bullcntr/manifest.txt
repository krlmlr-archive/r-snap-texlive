MEANING OF THE TERM "Work"
==========================

In the case of the bullcntr package, the "Work" is the collection of the
following 7 files:

00readme.txt        --  start by reading this file
manifest.txt        --  the file you are reading now
bullcntr.dtx        --  main source file
bullcntr.ins        --  installation script
bullcntr-man.tex    --  LaTeX source of package overview/manual
bullcntr-sam.tex    --  sample code that uses the bullcntr package
bullenum-sam.tex    --  sample code that uses the bullenum package

If you have received the 7 files listed above, you possess an integral copy
of the bullcntr package.



MEANING OF THE TERM "Compiled Work"
===================================

In the case of the bullcntr package, a "Compiled Work" is the collection of:

a) the following 5 files that are also part of the "Work" (see above):

00readme.txt
manifest.txt
bullcntr-man.tex
bullcntr-sam.tex
bullenum-sam.tex

AND
b) the following 3 files:

bullcntr.sty        --  the bullcntr "executable" package
bullenum.sty        --  the bullenum "executable" package
bullcntr.dvi        --  documentation in DVI format

You may, at your option, substitute (or supplement) the file `bullcntr.dvi'
with the following one:

bullcntr.pdf        --  documentation in PDF format

but at least one among the files `bullcntr.dvi' and `bullcntr.pdf' must be
included in a "Compiled Work" that you wish to distribute.  The file
`bullcntr.pdf' is obtained by submitting to the program pdflatex the file
`bullcntr.dtx', following the same steps as those explained in
`00readme.txt' under the title "How to generate the documentation".



ANCILLARY FILES
===============

The package of files distributed through the Comprehensive TeX Archive
Network (CTAN) includes also the following 2 files:

README              --  guide to directory contents
bullcntr-man.pdf    --  package overview/manual in PDF format

These two files are included only for the convenience of the CTAN visitors
and are _not_ a required part of the bullcntr package (of course you may,
if you wish, include them in your distribution too).



COMMENT
=======

Please remember that, in order to distribute a LPPL-compliant copy of the
bullcntr package, it suffices to distribute only the 7 files that
constitute the "Work".
