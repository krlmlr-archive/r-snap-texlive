The following files are enclosed.

  README           - This file
  *.sty            - the style files
  doc.html/        - doumentation in html format
  doc.dvi/         - doumentation in dvi format
  doc.ps/          - doumentation in postscript format
  perl/            - support for latex2html

The style file files are the following:

easy.sty
easyeqn.sty
easybmat.sty
easymat.sty
easytable.sty
easyvector.sty
easybib.sty

* easy.sty is a file which contains common definitions for all the packages.
  It is included from the others style files.

* easyeqn.sty introduces some equation environments that simplify writing
  of equations.  It uses a syntax similar to the array environment to
  define the column alignment.  The label field is fully customizable.  A
  package option permits to number only those equations that were ``labeled
  and referenced''.  Some additional macros are also included to facilitate
  typing of formulae.

* easymat.sty and easybmat.sty are useful for writing block matrices, with
  equal column widths or equal rows heights or both, with various kinds of
  rules~(lines) between rows and columns.  It uses an array/tabular-like
  syntax.

* easytable.sty is a macro package for writing tables, with equal column
  widths or equal rows heights or both, with various kinds of rules~(lines)
  between rows and columns.  It uses an array/tabular-like syntax.

* easyvector.sty is a simple macro package that provides a C-like syntax
  for writing vectors or matrices.

* easybib.sty introduces some new items for easy customization of the
  bibliography.

The support for latex2html contained in the perl/ directory is in an early
stage and is quite complete only for easyeqn package.

P.S. if you are an happy user of one of these macros I will appreciate
a postcard with a photo of your city.
