RefCheck.sty is intended to check references. It looks for 
numbered but unlabelled equations, for labels, which are not
used in the text, for unused bibliography references. Besides, 
it displays label and bibitem `keys' in text margins.

RefDemo.tex is a short description of usage of RefCheck.sty.
