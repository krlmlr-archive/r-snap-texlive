1 INTRODUCTION
==============

This package provides the command \hrefdisplayonly (additionally to \href of
the hyperref package by Heiko Oberdiek). While the (hyperlinked) text appears
like an ordinary nhref in the compiled pdf-file, the same text will be "hidden"
when printing the text. It is not really invisible, but just has the same colour
as the background (default: white). Therefore the layout is not changed when
printing the document.
Further the commands \hycon and \hycoff (hyper-colour-on/off) can be used
to simulate switching option ocgcolorlinks of hyperref package on and off.


2 DOWNLOAD
==========

`hrefhide' is available on CTAN:
  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/hrefhide/

Also a ZIP file is provided that contains the files, already
sorted in a TDS tree (should become available on CTAN soon):
  CTAN:install/macros/latex/contrib/hrefhide.tds.zip

`CTAN:' means one of the `Comprehensive TeX Archive Network'
nodes or one of its mirrors. This is explained in
  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=archives

The CTAN stuff will be mirrored automatically from the
ftp server, so
  ftp://ftp.tug.org/pub/tex/pagesLTS/
corresponds to
  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/pagesLTS/


3 INSTALLATION
==============

Installation with ZIP file in TDS format
----------------------------------------
The ZIP file `hrefhide.tds.zip' contains the files sorted
in a TDS tree. Thus you can directly unpack the ZIP file
inside a TDS tree.
(See CTAN:tds.zip for an explanation of TDS.)
Example:
  cd /...somewhere.../texmf
  unzip /...downloadpath.../hrefhide.tds.zip
Do not forget to refresh the file name database of this
TDS tree.
Example:
  texhash /...somewhere.../texmf

Manual installation
-------------------
a) Download the hrefhide files from CTAN or the TUG server.
   If necessary, unpack them.
b) Generate the package and driver files:
     tex hrefhide.ins
c) Install the files `*.sty', and `*.cfg' in your TDS tree:
     cp *.sty *.cfg TDS:tex/latex/hrefhide/
   Replace `TDS:' by the prefix of your TDS tree
   (texmf directory).
d) Copy the documentation files to
   "TDS:doc/latex/hrefhide/":
   README, hrefhide.pdf, hrefhide-example.tex,
   hrefhide-example.pdf.
e) Update the databases if necessary, e.g. for teTeX:
     mktexlsr .../texmf


4 ADDITIONAL PACKAGES
=====================

Depending on the driver and option settings, hrefhide loads
other packages:
* hyperref.sty:
    CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/hyperref.dtx
* kvoptions.sty:
    CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/kvoptions.dtx
* xcolor.sty:
    CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/xcolor/xcolor.dtx
which again load other packages
(see the result of the \listfiles command in the log-file
 of the example).


5 PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY
=======================

hrefhide must be loaded AFTER package hyperref:

  Package loading order:

  \usepackage[ocgcolorlinks]{hyperref}
  \usepackage{hrefhide}

7 BUG REPORTS
==============

A bug report should contain:
* Comprehensive problem description. This includes error or
  warning messages.
  * \errorcontextlines=\maxdimen can be added in the
    TeX code to get more informations in TeX error messages.
* Minimal test file that shows the problem, but does not
  contain any unnecessary packages and code.
* Used drivers/programs.
* Version information about used packages and programs.
  * If you are using LaTeX, then add "\listfiles". Then
    a list of version informations is printed at the end
    of the LaTeX run.
* Please no other files than the minimal test file.
  The other files .log, .dvi, .ps, .pdf are seldom
  necessary, so send them only on request.
* Please .zip or .tar.gz your file(s) before sending them!

8 KNOWN PROBLEMS
=================

* as yet: none... - Well, of course there are all issues
  of the hyperref package with ocgcolorlinks option,
  e.g. no linebreaks inside links.
