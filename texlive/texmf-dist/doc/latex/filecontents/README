Description
-----------

LaTeX2e's filecontents and filecontents* environments enable a LaTeX
source file to generate external files as it's run through latex.
However, there are two limitations of these environments: They refuse
to overwrite existing files; and, they can be used only before the
\documentclass declaration.  The filecontents package removes these
limitations, making it possible to overwrite existing files and to use
filecontents/filecontents* anywhere.


Installation
------------

There's nothing special about building filecontents:

    latex filecontents.ins     <== Generate filecontents.sty
    latex filecontents.dtx     <== Produce the documentation (filecontents.dvi)

If you're new to this, see

information on installing packages.
