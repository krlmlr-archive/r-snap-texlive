		Unslanted Digits in Adobe Utopia Italics
			     Version 1.2
			    Boris Veytsman


The Annals of Mathematics uses italics for theorems.  However, slanted
digits and parentheses look disturbing when surrounded by (upright)
math.  This package provides virtual fonts with italics and upright
digits and punctuation.

Changes:
	Version 1.1 - Changed the location of TFM and VF files
                      per request by Karl Berry

	Version 1.2 - Corrected the bug that lead to wrong size in
                      italics (thanks to AoM staff for noticing!)
