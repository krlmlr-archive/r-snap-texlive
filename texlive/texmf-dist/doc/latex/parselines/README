parselines

This is a simple line parser.

For files: \dofilebyline{filename} expands \do (a user macro with 1 parameter)
on each line of the given file, reading lines one after another with \read.

For text:
\begin{parse lines}{\row: #1}
 ...
 ...
\end{parse lines}

will add the number of the row before each line in the environment.

Other funny things can be done (see the .pdf ;-))
