The chet package is inspired by Paul Ginsparg's harvmac, but uses
LaTeX2e instead of TeX. The commands provided are to be used as faster
alternatives to LaTeX's default environments (which can all still be
used in chet).

To use chet just copy chet.sty and chetref.bst in the folder of the TeX
file you are compiling (or in your path) and include \usepackage{chet} in
the preamble of your LaTeX file.
