This is a small package that provides some (poor) LaTeX support for
the duerer fonts. The duerer fonts are part of many tex installations,
and is found on the TeX Live distribution.

*Installation*

Unpack the archive, and move the files into their proper directories

The files

duerer.sty
ot1cdin.fd
ot1cdr.fd
ot1cdss.fd
ot1cdtt.fd

should be placed in
TEXMF/tex/latex/duerer

duerer.pdf

should be placed in
TEXMF/doc/latex/duerer

duerer.tex is the source of duerer.pdf and no installation of it is
required. It can be deleted at will...
