2 - Introduction
    ------------

The shadowtext package introduces a new command, namely the \shadowtext 
command, which adds a drop shadow to the text that is given as its 
argument. E.g. \shadowtext{hello world} would produce the text "hello 
world" with a drop shadow. The color and positioning of the shadow are 
customizable.

    -------------

Documentation is available in the form of the file shadowtext.tex.


4 - Version History
    ---------------

v0.3: - Fixed some errors in the documentation
      - Colors specified in \shadowcolor should now be specified using 
        color names, not RGB values. The command for specifying colors 
        using RGB values has been renamed to \shadowrgb. 
        (I apologize for the backwards incompatibility).
      - The base line of the text is now correct.

v0.2: - First public release
