First upload of the `fileinfo' bundle to CTAN probably was 2010/11/27, 
followed by tries at encoding the README, so README.pdf was available 
2010/11/28. Both `myfilist.sty' and `readprov.sty' were v0.3.

2011/01/30 uses a fix of `makedoc.sty' and the new `texlinks.sty' for 
documentation. `myfilist.sty' v0.3a has 2 lines less than v0.3 and an 
updated copyright, `readprov.sty' didn't change. The .tds gets a 
`source' directory.

For r0.3b 2012/03/18, we write "elegantly" in place of "elegant" in 
`readprov.sty' v0.3a and update its copyright. We also hardwrap the 
present file (2012/03/16). Resuming work 2012/03/18, we use 
\MakeCloseDoc* from `makedoc.sty' v0.5 in `myfilist.tex' and 
`readprov.tex', add TDS-info to README, remove outdated `makedoc.cfg', 
and move `gather.tex' to `docsrc'.

r0.4 (2012/05/26) provides `myfilist.sty' v0.4 that allows reentering 
a package after \EmptyFileList, even when it has been loaded with an 
option before; mainly for the `nicefilelist' package:

    \RequirePackage[r]{nicefilelist}
    \RequirePackage{myfilist}
    \EmptyFileList[nicefilelist.sty]

r0.5 (2012/10/11) provided `myfilist.sty' v0.6 with a trick 
\FileListRemark  to insert "comments" in the file list, a hook 
\ListGenerator   to support `adhocfilelist', and 
\NoBottomLines   to suppress final messages, 
also issued by the new package option [no-bot]

But moreover, it provided `myfilist.sty' v0.5 as of 2012/09/27 
which I failed to upload. v0.5 brought \ReadListFileInfos, 
\WriteFileList, \ReadListFileInfos, and \UseFindUtility for 
the `adhocfilelist' package, or something else like that. 
I had thought that \WriteFileList could be useful, and it 
could perhaps with the -i option of `adhocfilelist'. 
r0.5 did announce `v0.5' literally, but described v0.6. 
Good that it hasn't been processed ...

r0.6 (2012/10/12) corrects this, i.e., the present file is 
corrected and updated, and the announcement is corrected. 
And `myfilist' v0.6a is provided where \UseFindUtility is 
added to the version history. Moreover, `readprov.pdf' has 
been typeset anew just to apply changes in `nicetext' and 
to avoid worrying in the future when I would not remember 
the problem (.aux files need to be removed, that's it).
-- Actually, I have modified `gather.tex' finally in order 
to have the *.sty's and `fileinfo.RLS' in adjacent lines.

r0.7 (2012/10/25) adds \NoStopListInfos in `myfilist.sty' v0.7 
so the script (`gather.tex') can continue with `filedate' 
consistency checks and their messages are the last lines 
you see on screen.

r0.8 (2012/11/11) keeps `myfilist' v0.7 while the new 
`readprov' v0.4 is a reimplementation sensible of 
\[No]FileDateAutoChecks from `filedate' v0.4.

r0.8a (2012/11/13) 
 * provides the proper `fileinfo.RLS' ...
 * applies more `filedate' tricks in `gather.tex' and new
   `fdatechk.tex' (see `Example' in `myfilist.pdf'), 
   `myfilist.tex', and `readprov.tex', supported by new 
   `makedoc.cfg' from `nicetext'.

r0.81 (2012/11/22): 

 * `myfilist.sty' v0.71 has a reimplementation of 
   \FileListRemark that works with `filedate.sty''s 
   \FileDateAutoChecks.

 * This is exemplified in `gather.tex' that generates the 
   list of LaTeX source files in the `fileinfo' bundle.

 * `readprov.sty' v0.5 provides \ReadShInfos to process

       # \ProvidesFile{<file>}[<info>]

   in shell script files <file>. This is exemplified in a 
   parallel upload of the shell script package 
   `adhocfilelist'.

 * The documentation inside both `.sty' files as well as 
   some settings in the documentation generators 
   `myfilist.tex' and `readprov.tex' have some adjustments/
   corrections.

 * While `myfilist' originally was made for use /without/
   typesetting (with "TeX scripts"), the documentation now 
   notes that `\ListFileInfos[<txt-file>]' can also be used 
   /with/ typesetting in order to get \listfiles output 
   in a separate plain text file `<txt-file>' (/without/ 
   remaining `.log' content).
