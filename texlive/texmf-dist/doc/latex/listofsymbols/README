Description: 
------------ 
listofsymbols provides commands to (a) automatically create a list of
symbols (also called notation or nomenclature) and (b) handle symbols
logically, i.e. define a macro that is expanded to the desired output
and use the macro in the text rather than `hardcoding' the output into
the text.
 
This helps to ensure consistency throughout the text, especially if
there is a chance that symbols will be changed at some stage. 
Additionally, you can keep all the symbols you usually need in
a separate file; only those you use in a document are included in the
list of symbols.
 
This package is more or less a combination of what the packages
nomencl.sty and formula.sty do. The concept of creating the list of
symbols, though, is different from the way nomencl.sty does it.

Change Log:
-----------
Jul 2003: Compatibility problems with amsmath.sty solved
Jul 2003: Unused symbols are no longer included in the lists
Aug 2003: Commands includesym and losstring added
