The LaTeX beamerposter package is an extension of the LaTeX beamer and the  
a0poster classes in order to create LaTeX posters, e.g. a DIN-A0 size LaTeX 
poster in landscape or portrait orientation. Furthermore it is possible 
to scale the poster fonts to your needs. 

The package allows you to benefit from the nice color box handling and 
alignment in the beamer class (e.g. with rounded corners and shadows) 
in order to create quite fast pretty conference posters.

Features:
    * scalable fonts using the fp and type1cm packages
    * posters in DIN-A0, DIN-A1, DIN-A2, DIN-A3, DIN-A4, and custom sizes 
      like double DIN-A0 possible
    * still applicable to custom beamer slides, e.g. 16:9 slides for a 
      widescreen (i.e. 1.78 aspect ratio)
    * orientation: landscape or portrait
    * debug mode
