This file is part of the cmdtrack package, released under the LPPL;
see cmdtrack.dtx for details.

This package (cmdtrack) logs \newcommand (and similar) commands
executed, along with whether they are used.

This package was written by Michael Downes, who passed away in 2003.  He
released it under a custom license, now considered nonfree.  In October
2012, his heirs (his children Zoe, Elizabeth, and Mia Downes) have all
agreed to re-releasing his work under any version of the LaTeX Public
Project License.  Therefore, the package is now released under the LPPL,
version 1 or (at your option) any later version.

The only change in this release is to the license.  The actual code is
the same as Michael's last release.
