CTAN description:
Prettyref provides a command  \newrefformat, which specifies the way in which a reference is typeset, according to a label \identification.  The identification is set in the  \label  command, by using prefixed label names; so instead of  \label{mysection}, one uses \label{sec:mysection}, and prettyref interprets the \sec: part.  The package is compatible with  hyperref  and with other packages.
