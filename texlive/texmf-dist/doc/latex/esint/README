The esint package is a solution to access to alternate integral symbols
using the Computer Modern fonts.

In the original Computer Modern Math font, several integral symbols are missing,
such \oiint. Many of those symbols are available
in other math fonts (pxfonts, txfonts, etc.), but there is no good solution if you
want tu use Computer Modern.

Run LaTeX on esint.ins to generate files.

Install the files:

-- esint.sty and uesint.fd on TEXINPUT;
-- esint10.mf, mathint.mf and bigint.mf on MFINPUT;
-- generate tfm files running METAFONT on esint10.mf files, and put
the *.tfm file on the right location.

Run LaTeX on esint.dtx to generate
documentation.

Updates:

*20/01/2005: minor change in esint.fd in order to avoid an error inside align environment.
Thank's to Eckhard Neber.


Contact me from my web page http://perso.wanadoo.fr/eddie.saudrais if you think
an integral symbol is still missing.
