Description
-----------

The forloop package provides the command \forloop for the user.


Installation
------------

To install this package, run forloop.ins through LaTeX.  This will generate 
a file called forloop.sty.  Put this file somewhere where LaTeX will find 
it---for instance localtexmf/tex/latex/forloop/  (note that you will need 
to create the folder forloop).

If you are using MikTeX, you then need to refresh the file name database 
by using MikTeX Options
