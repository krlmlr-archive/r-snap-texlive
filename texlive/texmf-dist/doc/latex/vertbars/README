The VERTBARS package
====================

Place vertical bars in the margin around material.
(Also see the changebar package.)
This package uses lineno to do its thing.

INSTALLATION

  vertbars.ins and vertbars.sty,
as well as to compile the PDF documentation.

Execute `tex vertbars.ins` to produce the files above
except vertbars.ins itself (and the PDF file, obviously).
