This package implements a version of semi-automatic pronoun switching
for writing gender-neutral (and possibly annoying) prose. The basic code
is due to Josef (no last name) and Martin Scharrer on
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/10787/

Modified to handle anaphoric reference to the current gender plus all
three case forms in both uppercase and lowercase. Includes an option to
flag to turn off xspace, and a silly option for replacing all pronouns
with 'they/them/their'.
