cp1251-light.def: Bug fix. To be sure that \cyrillicencoding is not
      specified, we now compare it with \undefined command. In previous
      version, the \@ifundefined macro was used instead. The side effect
      of this macro is that it lets an undefined command to be \relax.
      This leads to a bug when a cyrillic font encoding does not loaded
      before the russian style of babel.

nccbiblist.sty: A new package. It defines the biblist environment and
      redefines thebibliography environment. The definition of these
      environments was extracted from the ncc class and made
      class-independent on the base of the `topsection' package from
      `ncctools'.

ncc.cls: Use now the `nccbiblist' package for bibliography support. The
      related staff was removed from the class, `nccart.clo', and
      `nccbook.clo'. Preparing of tocs and indices is simplified on the
      base of the `topsection' package from `ncctools'.

nccindex.sty: Made independent on ncc class on the base of the `topsection'
      package from `ncctools'.

nccltrus.sty: Remove latest Babel's ``improvements'' to \flqq and \frqq
