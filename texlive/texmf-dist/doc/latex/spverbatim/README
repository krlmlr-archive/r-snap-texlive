	 | SPVERBATIM: Verbatim text with breakable spaces |
	 |	By Scott Pakin, scott+spverb@pakin.org	   |
	 +-------------------------------------------------+


Description
-----------

LaTeX's \verb macro treats its argument as an unbreakable unit of
text.  This can lead to poor typesetting, especially when the argument
is long.  The spverbatim package provides an \spverb macro that is
analogous to \verb and an spverbatim environment that is analogous to
verbatim with the difference being that \spverb and spverbatim allow
LaTeX to break lines at space characters.


Installation
------------

There's nothing special about building spverbatim:

    latex spverbatim.ins     <== Generate spverbatim.sty

If you're new to this, see

information on installing packages.
