gauss.sty -- A Package for Typesetting Matrix Operations
--------------------------------------------------------

To use the package, just place the  gauss.sty  file at a
location where TeX will find it, and insert

  \usepackage{gauss}

to your document's preamble.  This will define a new 
environment  gmatrix  whose usage is well explained in 
the  gauss-doc.dvi  file.
