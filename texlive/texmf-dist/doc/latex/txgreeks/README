This is the README file for the LaTeX2e package `txgreeks',
version 1.0, 2011/03/16

\usepackage[option]{txgreeks} 

Options:

TeX:     lowercase Greek italic and uppercase upright (default),
sloped:  synonym for TeX,
ISO:     lowercase and uppercase italic,
itgreek: synonym for ISO,
upright: lowercase and uppercase upright,
French:  synonym for upright,
upGreek: uppercase Greek upright (default),
itGreek: uppercase Greek italic.

\usepackage[itGreek,upgreek]{txgreeks} will give upright lowercase 
combined with italic uppercase.

Once the shapes have been decided the \other... prefix allows
to use the alternative: for example if \alpha is in italic shape
then \otheralpha will refer to the upright glyph.
