This package allows to create an index of all authors cited in a LaTeX
document.  Each author entry in the index contains the pages where
these citations occur. Alternatively, the package can list the labels
of the citations that appear in the references rather than the text
pages.

The package relies on bibtex being used to handle citations.
Additionally, it requires Perl (version 5 or higher).
