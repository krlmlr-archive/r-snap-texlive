August 2008:

- Describe workaround for bibunits (simplified from Sylwester Arabas's
  proposal)

October 2007

- Support names and citation keys longer than 79 characters.  Note
  that if you used you own bst script (via \authorindexstyle) in the
  past, you need to revise that bst script to include additional
  separator lines.

- Bugfix: Use semicolon as pathname separator on Windows

May 2007

- Bugfix: Allow the same BibTeX data base to appear repeatedly in the
  LaTeX source.  This is hard to avoid for when using chapterbib.

November 2006:

- Include an enhancement by Pieter Eendebak for natbib.cfg (part
  of the documentation)

March 2005:

- Support for authauthor and autheditor fields in BibTeX data base.
  These fields serve to provide a consistent spelling of author names

- Bugfix: When using multiple BibTeX data bases, they will be queried
  in the sequence given in the LaTeX source.  This is important when
  some data bases define @STRINGs used in others.

October 2004:

- Bugfix: Gracefully handle spaces in citation commands with multiple
  arguments.  Previous versions included the space in the key, which
  caused the search in the BibTeX data base to fail.
