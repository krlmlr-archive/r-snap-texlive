===== Prerequisites =====

To use this package, you need only 'etoolbox', though to generate
the documentation some other packages are needed.

===== Installation =====

noindentafter.sty is provided directly in the package archive. Put
it in a place where your LaTeX distribution can find it.

(noindentafter.sty is not generated, but manually maintained; you
 may use docstrip to remove the documentation, but you don't
 have to; it will just work the way it is)

===== Documentation =====

noindentafter.pdf is provided directly in the package archive. To
generate the documentation yourself, run LaTeX on noindentafter.tex.

(noindentafter.tex does not contain the package code itself; it inputs
 noindentafter.sty directly to document the implementation)
