The files in the mathtools bundle are:
    mhsetup.dtx
    mathtools.dtx
    empheq.dtx
and derived files. The derived files of each .dtx-file are listed
at the top of the respective .dtx-file.


INSTALLATION
============
Running TeX on each dtx file extracts the runtime files. See the dtx
files for details.

DESCRIPTION
===========


mathtools
=========

The mathtools package provides many useful tools for mathematical
typesetting. It is based on amsmath and fixes various deficiencies
of amsmath and standard LaTeX. It provides:
  -- Extensible symbols, such as brackets, arrows, harpoons, etc.
  -- Various symbols such as \coloneqq (:=).
  -- Easy creation of new tag forms.
  -- Showing only the referenced equations.
  -- Extensible arrows, harpoons and hookarrows.
  -- Starred versions of the amsmath matrix environments for
     specifying the column alignment.
  -- More building blocks: multlined, cases-like environments, new
     gathered environments.
  -- Math versions of \makebox, \llap, \rlap etc.
  -- Cramped math styles.
  -- and more...

mathtools requires mhsetup.

empheq
======

The empheq package is a visual markup extension designed to
function on top of amsmath. It features:
  -- Boxing multi line math displays while leaving equation
     numbers untouched at the margin. Any kind of box will do.
  -- Making the ntheorem package place end-of-theorem markers
     perfectly.
  -- Placing arbitrary material on either side of math displays.
     This includes delimiters that automatically scale to the
     correct size.

empheq requires mathtools.


mhsetup
=======

The mhsetup package defines various programming tools needed by
both empheq and mathtools. In the future, most of these tools will
probably be an integral part of LaTeX3.
