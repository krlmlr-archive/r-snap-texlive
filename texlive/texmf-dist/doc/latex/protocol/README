README for the package protocol


Please note: Without changes, this package is only useful for
             german users! It is planned to internationalize it, but
             up to now, I had no time for it. Everybody, who likes to
             help is welcome.

ERROR REPORTS
=============

Before you report an error, please check that:

  - the error isn't caused by obsolete versions of other software;
    LaTeX from 1986 is a good candidate ...

  - you use an original version of the package.


  If you think you found a genuine bug please report it together
  with the following information:

  - version of the file

  - version (date!) of your LaTeX

  - a short test file showing the behavior with all unnecessary
    code removed.

  - a transcript (log file) of the session that shows the error.

Please note that it is important to make the file as small as possible
to allow me to find and fix the error soon.

If you have an unchanged version of my package protocol, you can send me
error reports to

   protocol@tleine.de
