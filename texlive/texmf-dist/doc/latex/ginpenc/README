ginpenc.sty
===========

If the package inputenc is used and German Umlauts are input directly,
they are converted to \"a etc.  This breaks the sort algorithm of
makeindex, for instance.  This package converts Umlauts and the Sharp s
to the short forms, defined by the babel package, e.g. "a, instead, if 
the text is typeset in German.
