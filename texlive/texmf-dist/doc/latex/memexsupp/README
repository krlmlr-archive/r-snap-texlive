The memexsupp package is a package containing experimental code for
the memoir class. This is code that later in time, might, or might not
make it into the memoir core in some form or another. Please see the
Introduction in memexsupp.pdf for more details.

Note that by simply loading the package, nothing in memoir is changed,
you have the user has to actively use the macros from the package to
alter anything.

If any of the functionality from this package makes it into a future
memoir core release, this package will be updated and those macros
will be replaces with an error telling people to upgrade memoir.
