%   Badge size is 2-1/4" by 3-3/8" made on sticky-back paper.
%   The writeable area is 1-3/8" by 3", which is slightly
%   larger than the 1-3/8" by 2-11/16" label size of Avery 5329.
%   The quickest way to get badges is therefore to print onto
%   3 columns and 7 rows (21/page) of Avery 5329 gutter stock
%   and then stick these onto the badges.
%
%   Direct badges: Use 2x4 label stock for 10 badges per page. These
%   labels don't stick very well on clothing, that is why the cheap
%   badge material is useful.
%
%   Plastic badges: These generally cost 50 cents or more each and
%   accept a paper insert. The insert sizes are 2x3 and 2-1/4 by 3-1/2.
%   Print label inserts onto 60lb paper, whack apart with a paper
%   cutter and there you have it: badges.
