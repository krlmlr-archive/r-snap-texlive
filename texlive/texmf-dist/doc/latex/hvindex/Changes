hvindex.sty --------
0.03  2009-10-24  - fixed an introduced bug with the last version
0.02  2009-10-18  - makeidx and makeindex now depend on the
                    optional argument [makeidx]
                  - do not use @ operator when there is no
                    one in the argument
                  - added macros \iBraceL, \IBraceL, 
                    \iBraceR, IBraceR to get the braces 
                    well sorted depending to their ASCII number 
                    (thanks to Heiko Oberdiek)
