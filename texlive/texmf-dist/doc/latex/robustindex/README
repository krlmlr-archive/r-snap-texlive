 Package robustindex.sty, Wilberd van der Kallen Feb 2005.

 This package addresses two issues.

 1. Third parties often change the page numbers without rerunning makeindex.
 (Yes, it happened also to my 1993 book.)

 One would like to make the page numbers in the index entries more robust.
 We use the \pageref mechanism for that. Only after adding, deleting or
 otherwise modifying an \index{entry}, or after changing the order of the
 index entries, does one have to rerun makeindex.
 Other changes do not matter, as long as one runs LaTeX or pdflatex twice.

 2. The theindex environment does not create a hyperref destination.

 Therefore we introduce \indexincontents.
 It does what \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Index} or
 \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Index} should have done in the first place:
 When one clicks on the link that displays the word Index, one actually ends
 up in the index.

 Our package performs no miracles. But in simple situations all you need is
 adding the \usepackage{robustindex} to the preamble.

 The implicit page range formation of makeindex is disabled.
 Commands of the type \index{entry|editing command} are supported,
 but much more naively than in the encapsulating mechanism of makeindex.

 If you use hyperref, choose the option hyperindex=false, because our method
 to set up these hyperlinked indices is different.
 We tested a little with

 \usepackage[plainpages=false,hyperindex=false]{hyperref}

 See robustsample.tex for more details and illustrations.

 There you find examples like

 \index{alpha!see beta}
 \index{alpha!see also gamma\gobblepageref}

 \indexincontents % always put this before the index.
