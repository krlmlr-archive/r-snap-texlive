nfssext-cfr.sty is an extension of Philipp Lehman's nfssext.sty. nfssext.sty provides commands which enable one to specify font features not covered by the New Font Selection Scheme of LaTeX-2e. nfssext-cfr.sty provides additional commands, further extending the facilities offered by NFSS.

nfssext-cfr.sty is required by various font support packages I've written. It is being released separately to avoid unnecessary duplication and confusion. At least, I hope it will remove at least one source of unnecessary confusion. I have no reason to think it will avoid any of the others.

The code is highly experimental. It works for me. So far. If you discover problems, please let me know. If you know how to fix them, even better.
