%          The package "termcal.sty"
%              
% This package is intended to print a term calendar for use in
% planning a class.  It has a flexible mechanism for specifying
% which days of the week are to be included and for inserting text
% either regularly on the same day each week, or on selected days,
% or for a series of consecutive days.  It also has a flexible
% mechinism for specifing class and nonclass days.  Text may be
% inserted into consecutive days so that it automatically flows
% around nonclass days.


The tar file includes the following:

termcal.dtx	-- source file
termcal.ins     

termcal.sty     -- style file, derived from termcal.dtx
termcal.ind	-- index, derived from termcal.dtx

As usual the command "latex termcal.dtx" will print the
documentation. Since the documentation includes an example of the
use of the package, the style file "termcal.sty" is needed to print
the documentation.
