Typesetting exercises: the exercise package
===========================================

The package helps to typeset exercises or list of exercises within any
document.

Exercises, questions, sub-questions are automatically numbered. It is
possible to put answers in the same document, and display them
immediately, later in the document or not at all.

The layout of exercise is fully customisable. It is then possible to typeset
long problems, short exercises, questionnaires, etc.

Usage of the babel package is detected, but not fully supported by now
(only english and french are implemented). See documentation for more
information.
