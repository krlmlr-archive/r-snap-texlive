1 INTRODUCTION
==============

This package puts the label LastPage (\AtEndDocument) into
the .aux file, allowing the user to refer to the last page
of a document. This might be particularly useful in places
like headers or footers. -
When more than one page numbering scheme is used, or the
fnsymbol page numbering scheme is used, or another package
has output after this package, or the number of pages
instead of the last page's name is needed, or the page
numbers exeed a certain range, there might be problems,
which can be solved by using the pageslts package instead.

2 DOWNLOAD
==========

`lastpage' is available on CTAN:
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/lastpage

Also a ZIP file is provided that contains the files, already
sorted in a TDS tree:
  http://mirrors.ctan.org/install/macros/latex/contrib/
    lastpage.tds.zip


3 INSTALLATION
==============

First, please make sure that there is no old version of
lastpage at some obsolete place in your system.

Installation with ZIP file in TDS format
----------------------------------------
The ZIP file `lastpage.tds.zip' contains the files sorted
in a TDS tree. Thus you can directly unpack the ZIP file
inside a TDS tree.
(See http://www.ctan.org/TDS-guidelines for an explanation
of TDS.)
Example:
  cd /...somewhere.../texmf
  unzip /...downloadpath.../lastpage.tds.zip
Do not forget to refresh the file name database of this
TDS tree.
Example:
  texhash /...somewhere.../texmf

Manual installation
-------------------
a) Download the lastpage files from CTAN or the TUG server.
   If necessary, unpack them.
b) Generate the package and driver files:
     tex lastpage.ins
c) Install the file `*.sty' in your TDS tree:
     cp *.sty TDS:tex/latex/lastpage/
   Replace `TDS:' by the prefix of your TDS tree
   (texmf directory).
d) Copy the documentation files to
   "TDS:doc/latex/lastpage/":
   README, lastpage.pdf, lastpage-example.tex,
   lastpage-example.pdf.
e) Update the databases if necessary, e.g. for teTeX:
     mktexlsr .../texmf


4 ADDITIONAL PACKAGES
=====================

The lastpage package does not depend on other packages,
but the lastpage.dtx does (for unpacking and constructing
the documentation), see "7.1 Downloads" in the manual,
ftp://ftp.ctan.org/tex-archive/
macros/latex/contrib/lastpage/lastpage.pdf


5 PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY
=======================

lastpage is not compatible with the very old version 2.0
(and earlier) of the endfloat package. Newer versions of
endfloat exists (at the time of writing this documentation:
v2.5d as of 2011/12/25), which are available at www.CTAN.org.

* Author of the original main code: Jeffrey P. Goldberg (Thanks!)
* Author of the recent package and maintainer:

7 BUG REPORTS
==============

A bug report should contain:
* Comprehensive problem description. This includes error or
  warning messages.
  * \errorcontextlines=\maxdimen can be added in the
    TeX code to get more information in TeX error messages.
* Minimal test file that shows the problem, but does not
  contain any unnecessary packages and code.
* Used drivers/programs.
* Version information about used packages and programs.
  * If you are using LaTeX, then add "\listfiles". Then
    a list of version information is printed at the end
    of the LaTeX run.
* Please no other files than the minimal test file.
  The other files .log, .dvi, .ps, .pdf are seldom
  necessary, so send them only on request.
* Please .zip or .tar.gz your file(s) before sending them!
