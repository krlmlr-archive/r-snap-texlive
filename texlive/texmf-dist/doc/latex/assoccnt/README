The package assoccnt provides a way of associating counters to an 
existing driver counter, such incrementing the driver counter will increase
the associated counters as well. This package can be regarded as a supplement
to the totcount package by Vasileios Koutavas (http://www.ctan.org/pkg/totcount), but
can be used without it too.

Further improvements will follow


This version provides 

-- Informational routines for the last counter being stepped, refstepped, added or set 

-- A section on minimal requirements and incompatibilities with other packages

-- Improved manual (reordered descriptions)
