Description
===========

The goal of the savetrees package is to pack as much text as possible
onto each page of a LaTeX document.  Admittedly, this makes the
document far less attractive.  Nevertheless, savetrees is a simple way
to save paper when printing draft copies of a document.  It can also
be useful when trying to meet a tight page-length requirement for a
conference or journal submission.


Installation
============

Building the savetrees package is fairly straightforward:

    latex savetrees.ins             <= Extract savetrees.sty and savetrees.bst.
    latex savetrees.dtx             <= Build the documentation (savetrees.dvi).
    makeindex -s gind.ist savetrees <= Generate an index (makeindex.ind).
    latex savetrees.dtx             <= Add the index to the documentation.

To install savetrees, move savetrees.sty into a directory searched by
LaTeX (e.g., .../texmf/tex/latex/misc/) and move savetrees.bst into a
directory searched by BibTeX (e.g., .../texmf/bibtex/bst/misc/).
