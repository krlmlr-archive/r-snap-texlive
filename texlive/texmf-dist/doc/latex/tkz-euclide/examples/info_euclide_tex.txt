This archive contains all the examples of the documentation about tkz-euclide.

You need to compile a file with pdflatex or pfdtex to have in the same directory the file tkzeuclpreamble.ltx. This file is present in the archive.

You can also find  Makefile in the archive. The way to use the Makefile is :

$ cd <path of the archive>
$ make
