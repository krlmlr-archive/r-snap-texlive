1. What is it?
The LCD Package provides macros that display text which looks like on
alphanumerical LCDisplays.

2. Example
Look at the file example.pdf to get an overview.
The source can be generated by answering the question "There is an example
file in lcd.dtx. Generate it? [y/n]" with y when running lcd.ins thru TeX.

3. Generating lcd.sty
Because character with ASCII-codes greater then 127 are used in the
macro code, your TeX must be able to handle 8-bit ASCII to get a correct
stylefile! But in worst case only these characters will not work.
Making the documentation works without fixing this problem!
With teTeX the following works properly:

tex --translate-file=cp8bit lcd.ins

4. Making the Documentation
To get contents, cross references and index right, run TeX and makeindex
as follows:

latex lcd.dtx
latex lcd.dtx
makeindex -s gind.ist lcd.idx
makeindex -o lcd.gls -s gglo.ist lcd.glo
latex lcd.dtx

5. Files
00readme    example.pdf    lcd.dtx    lcd.ins
