Installing Prosper:
-------------------

Put all the ".sty" and the ".cls" files in a directory pointed to by 
the TEXINPUTS variable. Under Linux Red Hat with teTeX, I would suggest 
uncompressing the archive in /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/misc to have a 
prosper directory there (do not forget to 
run mktexlsr in order to update your TeX tree). Alternatively, create a
directory prosper somewhere in your home and add the path to the TEXINPUTS
variable. Example (under bash):

# cp prosper.tar.gz ~/TeX
# cd ~/TeX
# tar -vzxf prosper.tar.gz

and add the following line at the end of your .bash_profile file:

export TEXINPUTS=$TEXINPUTS:$HOME/TeX/prosper/
