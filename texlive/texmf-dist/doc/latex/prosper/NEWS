Version 1.5:
* bookmarks for all overlays
* Prosper is now distributed under the LPPL license
* Many bugs fixed

Version 1.1:
* corrected bug preventing correct use of \cite in slides with overlays.
* corrected reinitialization problem of the current color when 
  option "colorlinks" is true

Version 1.0i:
* Now, counters are not incremented inside overlays. Added macros to support
  this. Labels should no longer reported multiply defined in overlays either.
* Prosper now supports Adobe distiller for transforming PS files into PDF 
  files

Version 1.0h:
* Corrected a bug due to a counter name mispelling: when the user was not using
  a package redefining \stepcounter (such as amsmath), the compilation was 
  impossible.
* Style `autumn added'
* various small corrections in the manual

Version 1.0g:
* Style 'alien glow' added

Version 1.0f:
* Handles gracefully some problems arising when using babel/french with itemize
* Style 'darkblue' added
* Contributed style 'gyom' added
* Contributed style 'rico' added

Version 1.0c:

* Support of incremental displaying by using macros \onlySlide, \fromSlide
	and \untilSlide

Version 1.0a: 

* First version of prosper, an evolution of the (never released) fakeppt class.
  The main differences between prosper and fakeppt are:
  - styles 'plain' and 'outline' have been removed. The 'troispoints' style
    is now the default;
  - support for overhead projectors (by translating slides into the PDF format
    and displaying them full-screen with Adobe Acrobat Reader(tm));
  - development of new styles is easier and documented.
