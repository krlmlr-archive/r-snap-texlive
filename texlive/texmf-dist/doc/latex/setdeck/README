This is a style file for drawing cards from a Set Deck using TikZ in
LaTeX.


We use the convention
\setcard{<Number>}{<Shading>}{<Color>}{<Shape>}{<Scaling>}, where
Number  = 1 (1 card),       2 (2 cards), 3 (3 cards)
Shading = 1 (plain),          2 (striped),  3 (solid)
Color =      1 (red),             2 (green),    3 (purple)
Shape =    1 (diamond),   2 (oval),       3 (squiggle)



So for example, to typeset a full-size Set card with two striped red
squiggles, you would use the command \setcard{2}{2}{1}{3}{1}.  To
typeset a half-sized Set card with three plain green ovals, you could
use either the command \setcard{3}{1}{2}{2}{0.5} or
\smallsetcard{3}{1}{2}{2}{0.5}.  The only difference between the two
commands is the thickness of the lines on the cards.

The command \smallsetcard is designed to be used when displaying
anything smaller than a half-sized card.
