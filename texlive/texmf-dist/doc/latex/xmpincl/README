Readme for the XMP include package (xmpincl.sty)

The XMP (eXtensible Metadata platform) is a framework to add metadata to
digital material to enhance the workflow in publication. References are
given below, but the essenence is that the metadata is stored in an XML
file, and this XML stream is then embedded in the file to which it
applies.

How you create this XML file is up to you, but I started investigating
this, because I wanted to embed some licensing information in the files
I create. The license I chose is one of the Creative Commons licenses,
and their web-site offers this information in a valid XML-file, suitable
for direct inclusion.
