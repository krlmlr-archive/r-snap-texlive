% Note: this sample question dates from an earlier phase, in which
% `paper n' would contain a bundle of questions from various courses.
% That's why the \coursetitle doesn't match the broad range of
% subjects being 'examined'.
%
% Several of the questions are gibberish.
%
% This collection of questions has in part turned into an informal
% regression test for the class file.
