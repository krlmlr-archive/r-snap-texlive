exam-n: LaTeX class file for exams, version 1.1, 2014 May 03.
[ Mercurial revision 6f818b549982, 2014-05-03 13:42 +0100, tag 1.1 + 0 ]


Overview
--------

The class is designed to be localised to a particular institution's
exam layout, by a suitably skilled LaTeX hacker.  There are three
possible ways of doing this, in increasing order of sophistication:

  1. Make suitable adjustments to individual exam `.tex` files.

  2. Rename the distributed `exam-n.dtx` file to something more locally
     suitable, and edit it with suitable changes (search for
     `%%%CONFIGURE` for hints on where to adjust).

  3. Fork the Mercurial repository at
     [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/nxg/exam-n), change the
     value of the `EXAM-N` variable in the `Makefile`, and then
     edit the `exam-n.dtx` file.  See the comments at the top of the
     `Makefile`.  The command `make dist` will assemble a tarball
     release of the class file.

In the last two cases, if you change the `.dtx` file, you _must_ also
change its name, to avoid confusion.

For general details, talk to Norman Gray <norman@astro.gla.ac.uk>.

This is free software, and you are encouraged to use and adapt it as
you see fit.  If, however, you need more substantial help with the
customisations of option 3 above, or need continuing support, then
[Norman can help](http://8ameter.com), on a commercial basis.

With the version 1.1 release, the interface should now be regarded
as rather stable.  However version 1.1 was the first to be released
outside Glasgow University, so there may be some changes to the
interface which will emerge with broader use, as well as some bug
fixes.  The interface _may_, therefore, yet change.  If you use
this class to produce exams, it would be wise to include a copy of
the class file locally, rather than relying on a central version.  If
you need an earlier version of the class, let me know.


Documentation
------------

  * Documentation for question authors is in `notes-for-authors.pdf`.
  * The full version of the documentation, for 'exam conveners' (or
    equivalent) is in `exam-n.pdf`.  This and the author
    documentation are built as part of the distribution.
  * Basic documentation for a LaTeX localiser is in this file (see
    above), with extra remarks at the top of the `Makefile`.

There are brief release notes in exam-n.html.
