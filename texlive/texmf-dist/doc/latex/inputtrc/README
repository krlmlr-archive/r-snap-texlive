`inputtrc.sty' produces screen/log messages 
`<current> INPUTTING <next>' on LaTeX input commands, 
<current> and <next> being file names. 
The message indents reflect the input nesting level. 
This can be turned on and off, and the "indent unit" 
can be chosen. `RETURNING TO <current>' may be added.
These messages should help when you otherwise get a screen 
message about some input line number and wonder in which 
file that is.

The implementation somewhat resembles packages `currfile',
`filehook', `FiNK', and `inputfile'.

Typesetting the documentation requires the 'nicetext' bundle,
