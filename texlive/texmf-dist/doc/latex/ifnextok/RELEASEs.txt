Summary description
    make commands not skipping spaces, cf. amsmath/mathtools
Announcement text
    After hints on texhax by Heiko Oberdiek and on LATEX-L by 
    Bruno Le Floch (May 11) and Frank Mittelbach (May 15; 
    that I now finally read, 2011-06-02), \IfNextToken and 
    \IfStarNextToken of v0.21 essentially (not exactly) are 
    \new@ifnextchar and \@ifstar, resp., from amsmath; 
    main own features (i) control of where to employ them, 
    (ii) use outside math, indeed rather thinking of humanities. 
    Documentation now mentions amsmath and mathtools.

Summary description
    make commands not skipping spaces
Announcement text
    v0.2 provides \MakeNotSkipping<target>{<on-space>} 
    modifying a given document-level command <target>, 
    based on \IfNextSpace{<if>}{<else>}, 
    actually addressing what the abstract of ifnextok.pdf 
    has promised so far (including active double quote); 
    maybe rather showing problems than being practically 
    useful (as opposed to package options useful for end-users)

Summary description
    replacing \@ifnextchar so `\\ [' prints `[' in new line etc.
Announcement text
    `ifnextok' deals with the behavior of LaTeX's internal 
    `\@ifnextchar' to skip blank spaces. This sometimes has surprising 
    or for some users really unwanted effects, especially with brackets 
    following `\\' where the user does not intend to specify an optional 
    argument, rather wants that brackets are printed. The package offers 
    commands and options for modifying this behavior, maybe limited to 
    certain parts of the document source.
