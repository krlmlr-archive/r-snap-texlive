INSTALLATION

If you have downloaded the probsoln package using the TeX Directory
Structure (TDS), that is you have downloaded an archive containing
doc, tex and source directories, you need to follow the
"Installing from TDS" instructions below.

If you have downloaded the following files:

probsoln.dtx
probsoln.ins

You need to follow the "Installing from DTX and INS" instructions
below.

For further information on installing LaTeX packages see:

http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=installthings

INSTALLING FROM TDS
===================

Files in tex and doc directories should go in the
corresponding TEXMF directories (for example, /usr/share/texmf-local/
or C:\localtexmf\).

*Remember to refresh TeX's database*


INSTALLING FROM DTX AND INS
===========================

Run LaTeX on probsoln.ins to generate the probsoln.sty and the
sample files:

latex probsoln.ins

To create the package documentation (probsoln.pdf):

pdflatex probsoln.dtx
makeindex -s gind.ist probsoln.idx
pdflatex probsoln.dtx
pdflatex probsoln.dtx

If TEXMF denotes the base directory of your local TeX installation (e.g.
/usr/share/texmf-local/ or C:\localtexmf\) then create the following
directories (if they don't already exist):

TEXMF/doc/latex/probsoln
TEXMF/doc/latex/probsoln/samples
TEXMF/tex/latex/probsoln

Move the sample files (*.tex) to TEXMF/doc/latex/probsoln/sample/

Move the documentation (*.pdf) to TEXMF/doc/latex/probsoln/

Move probsoln.sty to TEXMF/tex/latex/probsoln/
