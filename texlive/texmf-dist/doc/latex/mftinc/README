Description
-----------

The mft program pretty-prints Metafont source code into a TeX file.
The mftinc package facilitates incorporating such files into a LaTeX 2e
document.  In addition, mftinc provides routines for improved comment
formatting and for typesetting font tables.


Installation
------------

There's nothing special about building mftinc:

    latex mftinc.ins     <== Generate mftinc.sty
    latex mftinc.dtx     <== Produce the documentation (mftinc.dvi)
    makeindex -s gind.ist mftinc    <== Generate an index
    latex mftinc.dtx     <== Incorporate the index into the document

If you're new to this, see

information on installing packages.
