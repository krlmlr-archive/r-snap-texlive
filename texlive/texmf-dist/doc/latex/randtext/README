The package "randtext.sty", which supersedes "switcheml.sty", provides a 
single macro \randomize{TEXT} that typesets the characters of TEXT in 
random order, such that the resulting output appears correct, but most 
automated attempts to read the file will misunderstand it.

This function allows one to include an email address on a TeX document 
and publish it online without fear of email address harvesters or 
spammers easily picking up the address.

For more information, please read the comments at the top of the package 
file.
