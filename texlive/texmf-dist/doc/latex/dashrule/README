               |   DASHRULE: Dashed rules in LaTeX    |

Description
-----------

The dashrule package makes it easy to draw a huge variety of dashed
rules (i.e., lines) in LaTeX.  dashrule provides a command,
\hdashrule, which is a cross between LaTeX's \rule and PostScript's
setdash command.  \hdashrule draws horizontally dashed rules using the
same syntax as \rule, but with an additional, setdash-like parameter
that specifies the pattern of dash segments and the space between
those segments.  Because dashrule's rules are constructed internally
using \rule (as opposed to, e.g., PostScript \specials) they are fully
compatible with every LaTeX back-end processor.


Installation
------------

There's nothing special about building dashrule:

    latex dashrule.ins     <== Generate dashrule.sty
    latex dashrule.dtx     <== Produce the documentation (dashrule.dvi)
    makeindex -s gind.ist dashrule    <== Generate an index
    latex dashrule.dtx     <== Incorporate the index into the document
