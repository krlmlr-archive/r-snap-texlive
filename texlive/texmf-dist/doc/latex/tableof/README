            Package `tableof' (v1.2, 2013/03/04)
             `tables of tagged contents' (jfB)

  The package commands \toftagstart, \toftagstop, \toftagthis,
  \tofuntagthis are used to flag chapters or sections or anything
  ending up in the .toc file following an (implicit or explicit)
  \addcontentsline. Then

  \nexttocwithtags{required1,required2,...}{excluded1,excluded2,...}

  specifies which tags are to be required and which ones are to be
  excluded by the next \tableofcontents (or equivalent) document
  command. For document with classes where \tableofcontents is
  only single-use, the package provides:

  \tableoftaggedcontents{required1,required2,...}{excluded1,excluded2,...}

  which removes this restriction.

  Installation:
  ============

 `latex tableof.dtx' or `pdflatex tableof.dtx'
  Run twice to get the bookmarks right.

  `tableof.sty', `tableof.ins' and `tableoftest.tex' are generated on
  the first latex run.

  Move `tableof.sty' to a suitable location within the TeX installation:
          tableof.sty -> ..path..to../tex/latex/tableof/

  `tableof.ins' is for TeX distributions expecting it.

  `tableoftest.tex' is an example of use of the package commands. Run
  latex twice on it to get the tagged tables of contents.
