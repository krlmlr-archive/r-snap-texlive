setspace -- control line spacing in latex documents

This release is a transitional one, with code unchanged from Geoffrey
Tobin's LaTeX 2.09 original, except for patches that avoid a problem
with \@setsize, when the package is used with other 2.09 packages
under LaTeX 2e.

The package now acts "natively" as a 2e package under LaTeX 2e, and
(insofar as is possibe) as a 2.09 package under LaTeX 2.09.

Please report any problems to Robin Fairbairns <rf10@cam.ac.uk>
(A revised version of setspace-test.tex, that shows the problem
reported, will be much appreciated.)
