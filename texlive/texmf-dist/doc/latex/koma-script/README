KOMA-Script is a versatile bundle of LaTeX2e document classes and
packages.  It aims to be a replacement to the standard LaTeX2e
classes.  KOMA-Script does not stop with the features known from the
standard classes, but it extends the possibilities in order to
provide the user an almost complete working environment.

Abstract:       scraddr is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.
                scrlttr2 uses adr-files to provide circuit letters.  Package
                scraddr provides commands to read such files and to use the
                data of the address entries not only with scrlttr2 class and
                not only for circuit letters.

Abstract:       scrartcl is a LaTeX class of the KOMA-Script bundle.  It is
                the KOMA-Script drop-in replacement of LaTeX standard class
                article.  It provides all options, environments, counters,
                lengths and commands of the LaTeX standard class article, but
                also several additional options, environments, commands
                etc. to make it much more versatile.  The default layout of
                scrartcl differs from article with emphasis on typography.
                Nevertheless by changing the defaults a layout very similar to
                the layou of the standard class may be accomplished.

scrbase - basic features for KOMA-Script, e.g. conditionals and key=value
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrbase is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle. It
                provides some basic functions used by KOMA-Script, that may be
                used as well by authors and users of other classes and
                packages.

                First of all it provides an extended key=value handling, that
                may be used for run-time options of classes and packages.
                Several packages of a family may share options and all the
                options of one family may be changed with a single command.

                Additional conditions like \ifundefinedorrelax, \ifpdftex,
                \ifVTeX, \ifpdfoutput, \ifstr etc. are provided.  Definition
                of most of them may be prevented from being defined and have
                additional internal representations, that may be used by
                package or class authors.

                It also provides commands to easily define or change language
                dependent terms and that work not only with babel but with
                other packages like ngerman too.

                It provides some commands for package and class authors
                missing in the LaTeX kernel like \ClassInfoNoLine,
                \PackageInfoNoLine or \l@addto@macro.

                Last but not least it provides commands for integer division
                and integer modulo operation, that may be used e.g. inside
                \numexpr ...\relax or with \ifnum.

Abstract:       scrbook is a LaTeX class of the KOMA-Script bundle and a
                drop-in replacement of LaTeX standard class book.  It provides
                all options, environments, commands, etc. of the LaTeX
                standard class book, but also several additional options,
                environments, commands etc. to make it much more versatile.
                The default layout of scrbook differs from book with emphasis

Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrdate is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  It
                provides several operations with calender dates, e.g. show the
                century or the decade of a year, calculate the day of the week
                of a given calender date, show the current calender date in
                ISO form. It has support for several languages, like English,
                German, French, Italian, Spanish, Croatian, Finnish, Norsk,

Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrdoc is an internal LaTeX class of the KOMA-Script bundle.
                It is an extension of ltxdoc.  KOMA-Script uses scrdoc for
                the implementation documentation and the documentation of
                packages, that aren't KOMA-Script core packages.  Currently
                there isn't any user manual for this class, because the only
                user is the KOMA-Script maintainer.

Abstract:       scrhack is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  It
                patches other packages to make them work better, add new
                features to them and to improve their interaction with
                KOMA-Script.  One main feature is, to make them work with
                tocbasic instead of the KOMA-Script's deprecated float list
                interface.  Currently patches for float.sty, floatrow.sty,
                (old versions of) hyperref, and listings are available.

                environments for contracts, laws, acts or other juristic
                puposes.  It supports automatic numbering of paragraphs and
                semi-automatic numbering of sentences.  Currently German and
                English are supported, but unfortunately there's only a German
                user manual.

Abstract:       scrkbase is an internal KOMA-Script packages, that provides
                some features that are common for several KOMA-Script classes
                and packages.  Users and class or package authors should not

scrlayer-notecolumn - control note columns parallel to the main text
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrlayer-notecolumn is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script
                bundle.  It provides a end user interface to above scrlayer,
                to define and manage note columns.  Those note columns are
                somehow similar to margin note (see LaTeX command \marginpar
                or packages like notecolumn), but you may use several of them.
                The package provides page breaks inside note columns and
                synchronization points between the main text and note columns.

                Like most of the KOMA-Script packages you may use this package
                not only with KOMA-Script classes but with several other
                classes, e.g., the LaTeX standard classes too.

Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrlayer-scrpage is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.
                It provides a end user interface to above scrlayer, to define
                and manage page styles.  This end user interface is as much
                compatible to scrpage2, that users should easily be able to
                switch from the old scrpage2 package to the new one.
                Nevertheless it provides several new features to control the
                page headers and footers.

                Like most of the KOMA-Script packages you may use this package
                not only with KOMA-Script classes but with several other
                classes, e.g., the LaTeX standard classes too.

scrlayer - defining layers and controlling page headers and footers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrlayer is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  Users
                may already know a kind of layers from packages like eso-pic
                or textpos.  scrlayer is another package, that provides
                background and foreground layers, but in difference to those
                other packages, these layers are part of the page style
                definition.  With this you may simply switch between usage of
                layers by switching the page style.

                In short words: The page style interface of scrlayer provides
                commands to define layer-stack-based page styles and to manage
                those layer stacks. 

                Nevertheless using the layers directly is recommended for
                advanced users only.  End user interfaces for beginners or
                average users are provided by additional packages, that load
                scrlayer on their own, e.g., scrlayer-scrpage.

Abstract:       scrlfile is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  It
                provides execution of commands before or after loading, files,
                classes or packages and even automatic replacement of loading
                files, classes, or packages by other files, classes, or
                packages.  It can also prevent a package from beeing loaded.
                It also provides execution of commands before or after closing
                the main aux-file while \end{document}.  Is has been used by
                the KOMA-Script classes for more than a decade.

scrlttr2 - versatile letter class with separation of text area and note paper
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrlttr2 is a letter class for LaTeX2e that allows definition
                of several note papers and text area settings, that are
                independent from the note paper.  So you may not only use
                KOMA-Script package typearea to define the text area and the
                margins of the text area, but even packages like geometry.

                The positions of the elements of the note paper may be changed
                by so called pseudo lengths. This makes it not only possible
                to adjust scrlttr2 to local conventions, norms and paper sizes
                but also to a wanted corporate identity.

                Several predefined parameter sets, called letter class option
                or lco-files, are for two German letters, Swiss letters, US
                letters, Japanese letters, and French letters are part of the
                KOMA-Script bundle. More may be found on CTAN or the
                KOMA-Script homepage as separate packages.

                Additional lco-files for different note papers may be found on
                the KOMA-Script homepage, e.g. one demonstration file for a
                note paper similar to the one of the Washington State
                University.

scrpage2 - control of page headers and footers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintainer:     Markus Kohm
E-Mail:         komascript at gmx info
Abstract:       scrpage2 is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  It
                provides facilities for changing the contents of page headers
                and footers.  You may either configure a predefined pair or
                page styles similar to headings and plain or myheadings and
                plain, use a simple user interface to define completely new
                page styles or a more complex expert interface to have more
                effective degrees of freedom in defining new page styles.

                scrpage2 also provides simple options and commands to decide,
                e.g., whether or not the running heads should be done
                automatically, which headings levels should generate automatic
                running heads, whether or not there should be horizontal lines
                above or below the page headers and footers, to change the
                colour or font of the page headers and footers (and the
                lines) and more.

Abstract:       scrreprt is the KOMA-Script drop-in replacement of LaTeX
                standard class report. It provides all options, environments,
                counters, lengths and commands of the LaTeX standard class
                report, but also several additional options, environments,
                commands etc. to make it much more versatile.
                The default layout of scrreprt differs from report with
                emphasis on typography. Nevertheless by changing the defaults
                a layout very similar to the layou of the standard class may
                be accomplished.

Abstract:       scrwfile is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  TeX
                provides only about 16 write handles available by \newwrite.
                With LaTeX not only the aux-file but each helper file like the
                toc-file, the lof-file, the lot-file and files like raw
                indexes and raw glossaries need one of those handles.
                scrwfile provides facilities to avoid all the handles of the
                helper files, that use the aux-file for intermediate writing.
                This means, that toc-file, lof-file, lot-file and files of
                packages like listings don't need a write handle anymore.  So
                the user will have more write handles for files like indexes
                or glossaries and may avoid `No room for new \write' error
                messages.

                scrwfile also provides facilities to clone helper files, e.g.,
                this may be used to have two tables of contents with different
                tocdepth settings.
Requires:       scrbase - some basic features for class and package authors
                tocbasic - basic features for helper files and lists of floats
                scrlfile - control of package dependencies

tocbasic - Management of tables and lists of contents using helper files

Abstract:       tocbasic is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle.  The
                main purpose of package tocbasic is to provide features for
                authors of classes and packages to create own tables or lists
                of contents like the list of figures and the list of tables
                and thereby allow other classes or packages some types of
                controll about these. For examples package tocbasic delegates
                language control of all these tables and lists of contents to
                package babel. So automatic change of language will be
                provides inside all these tables and lists of contents. Using
                tocbasic will exculpate authors of classes and packages from
                implementation of such features.

                KOMA-Script itself uses tocbasic not only for the table of
                contents but also for the already mentioned lists of figures
                and tables.

tocstyle - Control layout of table of contents, list of figures etc.

Abstract:       tocstyle is a LaTeX package of the KOMA-Script bundle. While
                the main classes of the KOMA-Script bundle were made, there
                where several ideas for formating the table of contents and
                lists of floats, but almost none of them where
                implemented. One reason was, that the KOMA-Script author
                didn’t like to change the LaTeX kernel at a class, because
                this may result in serveral problems with other packages. The
                package tocstyle will fill the gap. If it conflicts with
                another package, you simply may decide not to use it.

                The current release is only a proof of concept.
