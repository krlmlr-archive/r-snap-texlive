                WARNING:
                This file calls color and graphics packages
                without a driver option.
                You *must* set up two files
                                 color.cfg and graphics.cfg
                containing (for example)
                                \ExecuteOptions{dvips}
                Before running this file.

=============================================

TO UNPACK THE PACKAGES
======================

latex graphics.ins

This will produce the

.sty package files

Similarly you can run

latex graphics-drivers.ins

to produce the

.def driver files.

Not all supported drivers are included in this file as they are
maintained elsewhere.

NOTE (docstrip version)
***********************
****
**** If   latex graphics.ins
**** produces the `docstrip interactive mode' prompt:
****
****   * First type the extension of your input file(s):  *
****   \infileext=
****
**** Then your version of docstrip is too old.
**** Quit (eg by hitting `enter' to all questions) and get a newer
**** docstrip.tex. It must be at least version 2.4.
****
**** A suitable docstrip.tex may be found from `CTAN' archives such as
**** ftp.dante.de   tex-archive/macros/latex/unpacked/docstrip.tex
****
**** Docstrip is part of the base LaTeX distribution, so if you have
**** an old docstrip then your LaTeX is out of date and you may consider
**** getting the whole of that directory and re-installing LaTeX.
**** However you need to fetch only the file docstrip.tex to unpack
**** this graphics distribution with your existing format.

=============================================

USING THE PACKAGES
==================

Move files ending in .sty .def  to a standard TeX input directory.

Make a default option for your site by creating two files
     color.cfg and graphics.cfg
containing (if dvips is your default driver)
\ExecuteOptions{dvips}

You may then LaTeX the user guide:
latex grfguide.tex.

==============================================

MAIN CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE
============================

dvipdfmx and XeTeX support added.
Not all driver support files are included in since often more current
versions are available from their developers.
Removed pstcol.sty (now part of the pstricks distribution).
