      System Requirements: TeX, LaTeX or LaTeX2e


0. Introduction

The TeX clock provides little graphical and textual clocks to the
(La)TeX user community.

1. Installation

Unpack the archive clock.zip in some temporary directory.

teTeX users can proceed to section 1.2, MikTeX users should read
section 1.3.


1.1 emtex

If you are an emtex user, read and follow the instructions in the
file EMTEX.

1.2 teTeX (and other TeX systems based on the TeX Directory Structure)

Create subdirectories, either in your main TeX installation, or
in any local tree, with the following structure:

	mkdir $TEXMF/tex/latex/clock/
	mkdir $TEXMF/fonts/source/public/mfinput/clock/
	mkdir $TEXMF/fonts/tfm/clock/
	mkdir $TEXMF/doc/clock/

Copy the appropriate contents into the newly created directories:

	cp $TMP/texinput/*	$TEXMF/tex/latex/clock/
	cp $TMP/mfinput/*	$TEXMF/fonts/source/public/mfinput/clock/
	cp $TMP/tfm/mls/*	$TEXMF/fonts/tfm/clock/
	cp $TMP/doc/*		$TEXMF/doc/clock/

Rehash the file name database by executing texhash.


1.3 MikTeX

Read and follow the instructions in the file MIKTEX.



2. Running the TeX clock

The TeX clock is now ready for use. It is activated by stating

\usepackage{clock}

in the preamble of your LaTeX2e document, or by saying

\input clock

at the beginning of your TeX (or LaTeX2.09) document.
