ltxindex is a simple package to make indices for LATEX documents with
GNU's texindex. Though missing some important functionality, texindex
is much simpler to use; and if you don't need anything fancy, such an
index may be useful.

This package only implements the standard indices used by texinfo, and
only defines the concept index (cp) by default. You can't define custom
indices (yet), and you must set up the fn, ky, pg, tp, and vr indices on
your own. Read the manual for more information on usage, plans, and
limitations.

Good luck and happy TeXing,

Luis.
