* Description
=============

QCM is a package for making multiple choices questionnaires ("QCM" is the
corresponding French acronym) under LaTeX2e. A special environment allows you
to define questions and possible answers. You can specify which answers are
correct and which are not. QCM not only formats the questions for you, but
also generates a "form" (a grid that your students will have to fill in), and
a "mask" (the same grid, only with correct answers properly checked in). You
can then print the mask on a slide and correct the questionnaires more easily
by superimposing the mask on top of students' forms. QCM can also typeset
exams corrections automatically, and comes with support for AUC-TeX.


* Installation
==============

	To install the package, please follow these steps:

- Run LaTeX on the file `qcm.ins' to create the files `qcm.cls' and `qcm.sty'.
- Run LaTeX on the file `qcm.dtx' to create the doc   file `qcm.dvi'.
- Install these files anywhere you see fit.

	If you're an AUC-TeX user, you can also install the file `qcm.el' in
a suitable AUC-TeX style directory.

	Have fun!
