\begin{document}
This document shows an example of the use of the \emph{subeqnarray}
environment. Here is one:
\begin{subeqnarray}
\label{eqw}
\slabel{eq0}
 x & = & a \times b \\
\slabel{eq1}
 & = & z + t\\
\slabel{eq2}
 & = & z + t
\end{subeqnarray}
The first equation is number~\ref{eq0}, the last is~\ref{eq2}. The
equation as a whole can be referred to as equation~\ref{eqw}.

To show that equation numbers behave normally, here's an
\emph{eqnarray} environment.
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq10}
 x & = & a \times b \\
\label{eq11}
 & = & z + t\\
\label{eq12}
 & = & z + t
\end{eqnarray}

These are equations~\ref{eq10},~\ref{eq11} and~\ref{eq12}.
