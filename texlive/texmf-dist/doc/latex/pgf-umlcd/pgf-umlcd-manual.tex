\begin{abstract}
  \texttt{pgf-umlcd} is a LaTeX package for drawing UML Class
  Diagrams. As stated by its name, it is based on a very popular
  graphic package \texttt{PGF/TikZ}. This document presents the usage
  of \texttt{pgf-umlcd} and collects some UML class diagrams as
  examples. \texttt{pgf-umlcd} can be downloaded from
  \href{http://code.google.com/p/pgf-umlcd/}{http://code.google.com/p/pgf-umlcd/}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Basics}
\subsection{Class with attributes and operations}
Note: If you don't want to show empty parts in the diagrams, please
use \texttt{simplified} option, e.g. \lstinline|\usepackage[simplified]{pgf-umlcd}|.\\
\demo{class}

\subsubsection{Visibility of attributes and operations}
\demo[0.8]{visibility}

\subsubsection{Abstract class and interface}
\demo[0.5]{abstract-class}
\demo[0.5]{interface}

\subsubsection{Object}
\demo[0.7]{object}
Note: Object with rounded corners and methods are used in German school for didactic reasons. You get the rounded corners with \lstinline|\usepackage[school]{pgf-umlcd}|. If you need both in one document you can switch it with \lstinline|\switchUmlcdSchool| \\
\switchUmlcdSchool
\demo[0.7]{object}
\demo[0.7]{object-include-methods}

\subsubsection{Note}
The \lstinline|\umlnote| use the same syntax as tikz command
\lstinline|\node|, e.g. \lstinline|\umlnote[style] (name) at (coordinate) {text};|
