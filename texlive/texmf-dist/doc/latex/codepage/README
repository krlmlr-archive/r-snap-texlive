These files compound the package "codepage". This package translates all
the characters above 128 from differents codepage into TeX characters.

It works with all variant of TeX (Plain, LaTeX 2.09, LaTeX2e). However,
the printing of documentation and the installation of the code need
LaTeX2e (or a recent version of the DOC package).

The file "demo.zip" (binary file) contain two files with the same poem
from Arthur Rimbaud (a french poet). The first file is written using the
code page 850, the second using the code page ISO Latin set 1. Then
you will have at least a version of the two files which do not correspond
to your code page. Once all the files from the package "codepage" are installed
in your TeX's input directory, you can typeset them with LaTeX 2.09
(since these file were packed on a Unix machine, you should probably
use the "-a" option when you do the unzip).

To generate all the files of the package "codepage", the following
command should be issued: latex codepage.ins
To generate a french introduction to the package, the following command 
should be issued:
                    latex frintro.drv
To print all the documentation in english (4 pages of introduction on 
how to use the package and 45 pages about the code of package), 
the following command should be issued:
                    latex codepage.drv
