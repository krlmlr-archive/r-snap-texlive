1 INTRODUCTION
==============

This LaTeX package puts running, customizable thumb marks
in the outer margin, moving downward as the chapter number
(or whatever shall be marked by the thumb marks) increases.
Additionally an overview page/table of thumb marks can be
added automatically, which gives the respective names of the
thumbed objects, the page where the object/thumb mark first
appears, and the thumb mark itself at the respective
position. The thumb marks are probably useful for documents,
where a quick and easy way to find e.g. a chapter is needed,
for example in reference guides, anthologies, or quite
large documents. This material is subject to
the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL1.3).
See http://www.ctan.org/license/lppl1.3 for the details.


2 DOWNLOAD
==========

`thumbs' is available on CTAN:
http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thumbs

Running
tex thumbs.dtx
generates the files
thumbs.ins, thumbs.drv, thumbs.sty,
and thumbs-example.tex.

Also a ZIP file is provided that contains these files,
the manual (thumbs.pdf), the compiled example
(thumbs-example.pdf), and this README, already
sorted in a TDS tree:
http://mirrors.ctan.org/install/macros/latex/
contrib/thumbs.tds.zip


3 INSTALLATION
==============

Installation with ZIP file in TDS format
----------------------------------------
The ZIP file `thumbs.tds.zip' contains the files
sorted in a TDS tree. Thus you can directly unpack the
ZIP file inside a TDS tree.
See http://www.ctan.org/TDS-guidelines for an explanation
of TDS.
Example:
  cd /...somewhere.../texmf
  unzip /...downloadpath.../thumbs.tds.zip
Do not forget to refresh the file name database of this
TDS tree.
Example:
  texhash /...somewhere.../texmf

Manual installation
-------------------
a) Download the thumbs files from CTAN.
   If necessary, unpack them.
b) Generate the package and driver files:
     tex thumbs.dtx
c) Install the file `*.sty' in your TDS tree:
     cp *.sty TDS:tex/latex/thumbs/
   Replace `TDS:' by the prefix of your TDS tree
   (texmf directory).
d) Create the documentation (if necessary), e.g.
     pdflatex thumbs.dtx
     makeindex -s gind.ist thumbs.idx
     pdflatex thumbs.dtx
     makeindex -s gind.ist thumbs.idx
     pdflatex thumbs.dtx
e) Update the databases if necessary, e.g. for teTeX:
     mktexlsr .../texmf
f) Create the thumbs-example.pdf (if necessary), e.g.
     pdflatex thumbs-example.tex
     pdflatex thumbs-example.tex
     pdflatex thumbs-example.tex
     pdflatex thumbs-example.tex
g) Copy the documentation files to
   "TDS:doc/latex/thumbs/":
   README, thumbs.pdf, thumbs-example.tex,
   thumbs-example.pdf.


4 ADDITIONAL PACKAGES
=====================

Depending on the driver and option settings, thumbs loads
other packages:
kvoptions, atbegshi, xcolor, picture, alphalph, pageslts,
pagecolor, rerunfilecheck, infwarerr, ltxcmds, and 
atveryend, which again load other packages
(see the result of the \listfiles command in the log-file
 of the example).


5 PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY
=======================

thumbs should be loaded AFTER the required packages,
but loding it before those packages should be possible, too.
Thumbs MUST be loaded AFTER packages handling the page size,
for example geometry.

7 BUG REPORTS
==============

A bug report should contain:
* Comprehensive problem description. This includes error or
  warning messages.
* \errorcontextlines=\maxdimen can be added in the
  TeX code to get more information in TeX error messages.
* Minimal test file that shows the problem, but does not
  contain any unnecessary packages and code.
* Used drivers/programs.
* Version information about used packages and programs.
* If you are using LaTeX, then add "\listfiles". Then
  a list of version information is printed at the end
  of the LaTeX run.
* Please no other files than the minimal test file.
  The other files .log, .dvi, .ps, .pdf are seldom
  necessary, so send them only on request.
* Please .zip or .tar.gz your file(s) before sending them!

8 KNOWN PROBLEMS
=================

* When the text for a thumb mark is too wide,
the text is either split over two lines or is written over
the border of the thumb mark. When the text is too wide for
the thumb mark and cannot be split, LaTeX might nevertheless
place the text into the next line. By this the text is
placed too low. Please see the example file for information
about possible solutions.

* Right-to-left-writing with Polyglossary is probably
not compatible with thumbs.
