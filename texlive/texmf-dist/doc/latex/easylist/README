This is the file README for easylist.sty.  You'll find complete documentation in easylist-doc.pdf

This package provides an easy way of creating lists of numbered items (with as many levels as you
want-up to TeX's limitation) like:

1. First proposition.
1.1. Comment.
1.1.1. Another comment.
1.1.2. And I'd like to add...
1.1.2.1. By the way...
1.1.2.1.1. This is getting boring...
1.2. So let's start something new...

The advantage over usual LaTeX commands is that items here are created with a single active 
character in a recursive fashion. Moreover various layout options are available to achieve
maximum control (incrementing items, configuring styles, and so on).  

Licensing of this package is covered by LPPL.
