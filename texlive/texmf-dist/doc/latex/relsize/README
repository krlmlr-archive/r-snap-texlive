commands are:
\relsize{n}  where n gives the number of steps ("mag-step" = factor of 1.2)
             to change the size by;  n = 3 changes from \normalsize to 
             \LARGE size.  Negative n selects smaller fonts. n is an
             integer (or half-integer).

\smaller = \relsize{-1},  \smaller[n] = \relsize{-n}
\larger  = \relsize{1},   \larger[n]  = \relsize{n}

\textsmaller{text}, \textlarger{text} - versions that take an argument

\relscale{f}   like \relsize, but instead of scale-steps,
               the parameter is a scale factor, such as .75
\textscale{f}{text}

The font-size command nearest the requested size will be used, and if
the size error is more than \RSpercentTolerance, then the size will
be adjusted more precisely using \fontsize.  (The default empty 
\RSpercentTolerance signals automatic handling, choosing the tolerance 
based on the font declarations.)

\mathsmaller{A}, \mathlarger{B}       - math versions 
  (The math versions are entirely different from the text versions.)
