The mciteplus LaTeX package is an enhanced reimplementation of
Thorsten Ohl's mcite package:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mcite/

which provides support for the grouping of multiple citations together
as is often done in physics journals. An extensive set of features
provide for other applications such as reference sublisting.

Mciteplus offers the following features, many of which are not available
with the original mcite:

 1. Entry punctuation can be controlled by the bibstyle (.bst) as well
    as the user.

 2. No "double periods" when an entry already ends with a period
    (e.g., an abbreviated journal name).

 3. Support for sublists.

 4. Support for multiple bibliographies and/or auxiliary files.

 5. The bibliography sample label width is automatically updated to
    account for the changes in the numbering due to the grouped entries.
    Maximum label width information is available to user.

 6. Compatible with the natbib package. (The bibstyle must support both
    mciteplus as well as natbib.)

 7. Compatible with the REVTeX4 class. (The bibstyle must support both
    mciteplus as well as natbib.)

 8. Support for the optional argument of \cite[]{}.

 9. Provides a means to allow users to use almost any cite command via
    custom command wrappers and the ability to manually disable all
    automatic internal hooks.

10. Mciteplus compatible sorting bibstyles are possible via the use of a
    "mcitetail" field in the BibTeX database entries.


Please note that existing mcite bibstyles (.bst files) are not compatible
with mciteplus. They will have to be remodified as explained in the
mciteplus documentation.

See the mciteplus_doc.pdf user manual for full details.
