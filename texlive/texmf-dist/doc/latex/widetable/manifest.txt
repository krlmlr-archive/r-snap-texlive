This small package is intended to be a second resource when typesetting
tables that would look a little better if they were set with a specified width.
It differs from tabularX since here all cells are widened by working on the
inter column glue, not on the measure of certain specified textual cells  as
it is done with tabularX. Computations may be executed by means of the e-TeX
extensions if they are available.
