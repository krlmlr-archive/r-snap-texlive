The quoting package

Overview

As an alternative to the LaTeX standard environments quotation and
quote, the quoting package provides a consolidated environment for
displayed text. First-line indentation is activated by adding a blank
line before the quoting environment. A key--value interface allows to
configure font properties and spacing and to control orphans within and
after the environment.
