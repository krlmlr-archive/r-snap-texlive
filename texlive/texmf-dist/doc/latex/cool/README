Description
-----------

The cool of the cool package stands for COntent Oriented LaTeX.  It is designed 
to give LaTeX the power to retain mathematical meaning of its expressions in
addition to the typsetting instructions.

One advantage of keeping mathematical meaning is that conversion of LaTeX
documents to other executable formats (such as Content MathML or Mathematica
code) is greatly simplified.

This package requires the following, non-standard LaTeX packages 
(all of which are available on www.ctan.org):

* coolstr
* coollist
* forloop


Installation
------------

To install this package, run cool.ins through LaTeX.  This will generate 
a file called cool.sty.  Put this file somewhere where LaTeX will find 
it---for instance localtexmf/tex/latex/cool/  (note that you will need 
to create the folder cool).

If you are using MikTeX, you then need to refresh the file name database 
by using MikTeX Options
