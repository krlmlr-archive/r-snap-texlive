The goal of this package is the simplest possible provision of
map images (OpenStreetMap, Google Maps and Google Street View
are supported). In the simplest case, the specification of an
address is sufficient. The package loads the map using the
\write18 feature, which you must activate to use this package.
The image will be downloaded by an external Lua script. You can
use this script also from the command line.

Changes in v1.8:

- added support for long routes by the gps2gps mode (getmapdl.lua)

  Long routes might be defined by several thousands of way points.
  Encoding these into a encoded polyline would hugely exceed the
  URL length limit of 2048 bytes. The gps2gps mode allows you to
  reduce the number of gps coordinates based on a given bound.

- added multi route support for gps2epl mode

- updated documentation

  INSTALL
===========

First of all, install the package with the package manager of
your TeX distribution, if possible! A getmap package is
available for TeXLive2014+ and MiKTeX!

Manual installation:

download getmap.dtx and makefile (Linux) or install.bat (Windows)

* Linux

  simply run  make  to extract the files and to create the
  documentation. Run  sudo make install  to copy the files
  into $TEXMFLOCAL

  Moreover, there are the following usefull make targets:

  uninstall  deletes the package in $TEXMFOCAL
  package    only extracts the files
  clean      cleans all aux files
  cleanall   cleans all files except the downloaded files

* Windows

  In MiKTeX scripts like getmapdl.lua must be registered.
  This can not be done manually! Please use the package
  manager to install getmap.

  For TeXLive simply run install.bat! It assumes that you
  use a standard installation of TeXLive2014. Otherwise you
  must adjust the variables in the first lines of install.bat!
