DESCRIPTION

TeXmate formats chess games from very simple ascii input. The clean "1. e4 e5; 2. Nf3 Nc6; 3. Bb5 a6" will produce the same results as the sloppier "1  e4 e5; Nf3 Nc6 3.. Bb5 a6". The resulting format is fully customizable.

There are 4 levels of commentary: 1 is the main game, 2-3 are commentaries. Each has its fonts, punctuation marks, etc., and these are also customizable.

The second version has the ability to create diagrams of the position on the board at any time, working in connection with package skak.

DOCUMENTATION

The user's manual is file texmate2manual.pdf. The commented code is produced by running LaTeX on texmate.dtx.


INSTALLATION

Run TeX on texmate.ins. This will create texmate.sty, the package file, which should go in the "tex\latex\texmate" folder.

The dtx and ins to "\source\latex\texmate"

The pdf's and the tex to "\doc\latex\texmate"


It's a good idea to install the skak package as well, for the fonts. But the font files come here in case you want to install them manually.
