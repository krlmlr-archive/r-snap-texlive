Introduction
------------

Two packages are contained here -- ``quoted'' providing a single
command to use inline quotes in a specific language, and ``onedash''
to typeset dashes in a specific style and language.

Unlike widely used alternatives, the exact appearance of the
characters produced by these packages is specified only in their
options.

Getting this package
--------------------

This package has a website at
``http://mtjm.eu/projects/logical-markup-utils''.

It is currently available from a Mercurial repository at
``http://hg.mtjm.eu/logical-markup-utils/''.

Usage of quoted
---------------

\usepackage[options]{quoted}

Supported options are:
- ``american'' (default)
- ``british''
- ``german''
- ``polish''
Their meaning should be obvious.

Four commands are defined to be used: ``\quoted'' formats its argument
in correct quotes.  If it is used inside of the argument, the quotes
are changed to the inner format.  If they are chosen incorrectly, the
command ``\inquote'' will change the style to the other one.  The
commands ``\lquote'' and ``\rquote'' just typeset the quote marks in
the current style without changing it.

When not using multi-paragraph quotes, most probably only the
``\quoted'' command will be needed.

No punctuation is moved in or out of the quotes.

Usage of onedash
----------------

\usepackage[options]{onedash}

Supported options are:
- ``american'' (default)
- ``british''
- ``polish'' -- with endash
- ``polish-emdash''

The package declares the ``\dash'' command which typesets a dash using
style selected by the option.

Two more available commands are useful only in Polish texts:
- ``\pdash'' typesets a dash beginning a line of dialogue (in English
  it is not needed, since quotes are used to mark dialogue)
- ``\hyph'' typesets a correct hyphenable hyphen for Polish words like
  ``biało-czerwony'' (in English hyphens are hyphenated differently so
  they do not need this command)
