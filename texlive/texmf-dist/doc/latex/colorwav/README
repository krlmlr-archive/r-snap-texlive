Description
-----------

The colorwav package is a package that allows one to specify a wavelength (default
in nanometers) and retrieve the RGB value based upon code written by Dan Bruton.

Installation
------------

To install this package, run colorwav.ins through LaTeX.  This will generate 
a file called colorwav.sty.  Put this file somewhere where LaTeX will find 
it---for instance localtexmf/tex/latex/colorwav/  (note that you will need 
to create the folder colorwav).

If you are using MikTeX, you then need to refresh the file name database 
by using MikTeX Options
