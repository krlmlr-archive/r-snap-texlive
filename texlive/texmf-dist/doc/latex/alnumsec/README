Abstract

  alphanumeric sectioning numbering with standard sectioning commands

  This package allows you to use alphanumeric section numbering, e.g.:
  A. Introduction; III. International Law. It s output is similar to
  alphanum.sty, but you can use the standard LaTeX sectioning commands.
  Thus it is possible to switch numbering schemes easily. Greek letters,
  double letters (bb) and different delimiters around them are supported.

  Since version v0.02, full references are always printed, even if the
  section numbers do not include higher level numbers.
