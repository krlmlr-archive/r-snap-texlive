____________________
The addlines package
v0.2

This package provides the command \addlines for adding
or removing space in the textblock of the page it's
used on. E.g., adding an extra line of text to the page
so that a section fits better on the next page.

It will also add space to the *facing* page in a
two-sided document.

An inverse command is provided if you prefer it:
  \removelines{ x } == \addlines{ -x }

See addlines.pdf for more info.
