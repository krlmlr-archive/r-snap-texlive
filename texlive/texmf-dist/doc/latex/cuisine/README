Cuisine is a LaTeX package for typesetting recipes in steps in which each
ingredient is on the left of the page next to the method step in which it
is used.

To install the package, run TeX on cuisine.ins to produce cuisine.sty; move
this to somewhere in your TEXINPUTS path.  Run LaTeX on cuisine.dtx twice
to produce the documentation file cuisine.dvi.
