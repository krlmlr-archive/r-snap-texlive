h2. Presentation

@tex-upmethodology@ is a (La)TeX style which permits to create Unified Process methodology (UP or RUP) based documents (document version, history, authors, validators, specification, task management, helping tools...)

Because the @tex-upmethodology@ package is based on external definitions of layouts and styles, it is also succesfully used as a base to write scientific documents such as *reports*, *engineering thesis*, *master thesis*, and *PhD thesis*. An example of PhD thesis styles may be found at: http://www.multiagent.fr/ThesisStyle

h2. Installation

# Copy the content of the directory inside one of your @texmf@ directory, usually @/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/upmethodology@ or @$HOME/.texmf@ on Unix operating systems.
# Update the LaTeX databases from the command line:

 $> mktexlsr
 $> update-updmap --quiet
