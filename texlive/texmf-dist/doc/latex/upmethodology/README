1. Presentation
---------------

tex-upmethodology is a (La)TeX style which permits to create Unified Process methodology (UP or RUP) based documents (document version, history, authors, validators, specification, task management, helping tools...)

Because the tex-upmethodology package is based on external definitions of layouts and styles, it is also succesfully used as a base to write scientific documents such as reports, engineering thesis, master thesis, and PhD thesis. An example of PhD thesis styles may be found at: http://www.multiagent.fr/ThesisStyle
