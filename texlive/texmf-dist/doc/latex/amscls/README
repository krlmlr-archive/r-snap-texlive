See manifest.txt for a list of all the files in the distribution.

See install.txt for installation instructions.

The document classes amsart, amsbook, amsproc and related packages are
provided by the American Mathematical Society for authors to use with
LaTeX. They produce the overall layout and appearance of AMS
publications.

In order to use an AMS document class you need to have TeX software
installed first. TeX is not an AMS product. If you need information on
getting TeX see one of the following:

  http://www.tug.org/
  http://www.ams.org/tex/tex-resources.html

Documentation for the AMS document classes is found in

  instr-l.pdf
  diffs-c.txt
  amsthdoc.pdf
  thmtest.tex
  thmtest.pdf

which are included in the collection.  Additional documentation can be
found in the amsclass FAQ:

  http://www.ams.org/tex/amsclass-faq.html

The recommended procedure for making a custom document class based on an
AMS class is to make a copy of the relevant .cls file using a different
name and edit the copy---e.g., copy amsbook.cls to mybook.cls. (In
general we advise against using \LoadClass, unless the base class is
frozen or changes to the base class are under your control.)
