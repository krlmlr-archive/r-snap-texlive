_________________
The COMBINE class

    The combine class lets you bundle individual documents into
a single document, such as when preparing a conference proceedings.

    The auxiliary combinet package puts the titles and authors from
\maketitle commands into the main document's table of contents and the
combnat package enables the combine class and the natbib package
to be used harmoniously together. The auxiliary combcite package
provides a version of the cite package for use with the combine class.
