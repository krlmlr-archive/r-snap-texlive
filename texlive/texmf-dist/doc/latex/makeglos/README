The makeglos package


makeglos is a LaTeX package to include a glossary into a document.
The glossary must be prepared by an external program, like xindy or
makeindex.


Features

* Can be easily configured: various aspects of the appearance of the
  glossary can be changed by a simple \renewcommand.

* Multi-language capability: certain keywords, like the name of the
  glossary, can be made language-dependent.

* Flexible: works equally well for document classes with a book- or
  report-like structure (divided into \chapters) and for article-like
  documents, like the documentation for the makeglos package (based on
  \sections)
* Equivalent: makeglos is to glossaries what makeidx is to indices.
