Starting with TeX Live 2010, the various formats that directly generate PDF
default to PDF 1.5. While this allows for more compact documents thanks to
objects compression, it can also lead to compatibility issues with some older
PDF viewers. This package changes back the version of generated PDF to 1.4 with
formats based on pdfTeX or LuaTeX in PDF mode, for documents that need to
achieve maximal compatibility with old viewers.

If you need to generate maximally compatible documents, you may also be
interested in the pdfx package.
