This README for lpic package


The package lpic defines convenient interface to put any
LaTeX material on top of included graphics. 
LaTeX material could also be rotated and typeset on top of a white
box overshadowing graphics. Coordinates of LaTeX boxes are
given relative to the original, unscaled graphics, when graphics is
rescaled, LaTeX annotations stay at their right places (unless you
do something extreme). In a draft mode it allows to draw a coordinate
grid over the picture for easy adjustment of positions of the annotations.
