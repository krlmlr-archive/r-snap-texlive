OVERVIEW: This is LaTeX package 'wordlike' for simulating word
processor layout. The package consists of these files:

 * wordlike.ins
 * wordlike.dtx
 * README
 * wordlike.pdf

These packages are REQUIRED for running 'wordlike':
courier, geometry, helvet, mathptmx.
They are usually installed on a TeX system.

INSTALLATION is done in six steps:

 1. move wordlike.ins and wordlike.dtx into the same directory
 2. call latex wordlike.ins -> generates wordlike.sty
 3. call latex wordlike.dtx twice -> generates user guide wordlike.dvi
 4. move wordlike.sty to texmf-local/tex/latex/wordlike
 5. move wordlike.dvi to texmf-local/doc/latex/wordlike
 6. call mktexlsr/texhash for updating TeX's file name database
