             Copyright (C) 2010  Sergey Goldgaber

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Using this package you can generate thumb indexes for your document.
Thumby features printing  thumb indexes on one-  or two-sided pages,
along with background- and foreground-color selection and full LaTeX
styling of the  chapter numbers in the thumb indexes.  The height of
each  thumb index  is automatically  chosen based  on the  number of
chapters in your document, while the width is chosen by the user.
