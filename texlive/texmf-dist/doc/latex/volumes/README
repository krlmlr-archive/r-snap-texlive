Abstract

 	volumes.sty - Typeset only parts of a document, with complete indices etc.

	This package tries to help you if you want to produce separate printed volumes
	from one LaTeX document, as well as one comprehensive, "all-inclusive" version. 
	It suppresses the part of the table of contents that are not typeset, while 
	counters, definitions, index entries etc. are kept consistent throughout the 
	input file.

To produce the style and auxiliary files

	latex volumes.ins


To produce the documentation 

  (pdf)latex volumes.dtx

	To produce an index for the documentation:

    makeindex -s gind.ist volumes

  To produce a change history for the documentation:
  
    makeindex -s gglo.ist -o volumes.gls volumes.glo
