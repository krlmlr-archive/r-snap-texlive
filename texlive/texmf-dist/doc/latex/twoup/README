The twoup package provides a one-size-fits-all solution to two-up
printing.

The twoup package requires either the 2up package, the booklet
package, or that you use the postscript tools psnup and psbook.
The packages are available from CTAN and the postscript tools are
included with many TeX distributions.

The twoup package is distributed under the LaTeX Project Public
License.
