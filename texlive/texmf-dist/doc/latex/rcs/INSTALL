You're not on Unix?  Jump ahead to `INSTALLATION BY HAND'.


INSTALLATION ON UNIX
====================

I have supplied a Makefile for your convenience. You have to edit it
to tell make where your TeX installation lives.

Do you have a TDS-compliant installation?
(E.g., teTeX, highly recommended.)

    yes => Change the value of TEXMF to your TDS root directory.
    no  => Change even more variables (the ones below TEXMF).
	   Make sure all parent directories exist.

Do you use AUC-TeX?

    yes => Assign your AUC-TeX directory to AUCTEX.
    no  => Doesn't matter, let the current AUCTEX value as it is.


Type
	make

Everything should be installed now.

If you have a TDS installation structure and make complains that the
LaTeX directory is not found, install LaTeX first.



TYPESET REVISION LOGS
---------------------

If you want to typeset revision logs, you need a configurable RCS. We
created a version, which is currently in beta test. You'll find it in
ftp.th-darmstadt.de:pub/programming/management/confrcs/.



INSTALLATION BY HAND
====================

Copy rcs.sty to some directory where LaTeX finds it.
    The correct TDS directory name is tex/latex/misc/, relative to the
    TDS root.

Copy *.dvi from the current directory to the directory
where you keep the documentation for your installed LaTeX styles.
    What? You don't have such a directory? Shame on you. ;-)
    The TDS proposes one the following directory names: doc/latex/rcs
    or doc/latex/styles/rcs/. I use the latter.

If you use AUC-TeX, copy style/rcs.el to the directory <auctex>/style.
Here <auctex> is either the directory, where AUC-TeX is installed, or
it is the directory where you keep your personal LaTeX style files.
(If that's all Greek to you, refer to the installation instructions of
AUC-TeX.)
