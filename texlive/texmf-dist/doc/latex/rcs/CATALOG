Description: RCS is a revision control system, used for managing
  versions and variants of files. It's possible to include
  automatically information from this system in the managed files.
  rcs.sty is a LaTeX package that helps to typeset this information
  (last check-in date, revision number, etc.)
    With the help of a configurable RCS system, one can also typeset
  the revision log (aka version history).

Keywords: LaTeX package, RCS, Revision Control System, Literate
  Programming, File documentation

Note: Some old rcs.sty files exist, by various authors; this package
  is upward-compatible to them.
