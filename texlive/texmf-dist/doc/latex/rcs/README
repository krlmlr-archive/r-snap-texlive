The rcs package utilizes the inclusion of RCS supplied data in
LaTeX documents. It's upward compatible to *all* rcs styles I know of.

In particular, you can easily
 -- access values of every RCS field in your document
 -- put the checkin date on the titlepage
 -- put RCS fields in a footline

You can typeset revision logs. Not in verbatim -- real LaTeX text! But
you need a configurable RCS for that. Refer to the user manual for
more detailed information.

You can also configure the rcs package easily to do special
things for any keyword.
    This bundle comes with a user manual, an internal interface
description, full documentation of the implementation, style
information for AUC-TeX, and test cases.


Concerning compatibility: The user interfaces of Piet van Oostrum's,
Nelson Beebe's, and Tom Verhoeff's style are supported. It is also
compatible to previous versions of this style option (of course).
I.e., the confusion of multiple incompatible rcs style options should
be resolved now.


MANIFEST features a list of files in this distribution.
For installation instructions, check the file INSTALL.

	I've finally learned what "upward compatible" means.  It means we get
	to keep all our old mistakes.				[D. van Tassel]
