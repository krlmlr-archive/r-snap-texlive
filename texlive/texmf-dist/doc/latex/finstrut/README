            README for the `finstrut' package
           \@finalstrut allowing vertical mode
                (C) Uwe Lueck 2011/02/24


`finstrut.sty' changes LaTeX's \@finalstrut (that is 
automatically inserted at the end of footnote text and 
paragraph table columns) so that it does not produce an 
extra empty line in vertical mode, e.g., with \lipsum from 
lipsum.sty for dummy text.

KEYWORDs: footnotes, tables; dummy text, macro programming
