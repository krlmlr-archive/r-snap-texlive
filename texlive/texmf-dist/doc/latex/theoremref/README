The theoremref package provides variants of the \label and \ref
commands for theorem-like environments, capable of automatically
typesetting references including the theorem name (apart from the theorem
number). This comes handy if you do not feel like manually checking
and fixing every \ref command in your file whenever you need to change
a Lemma to a Proposition or Theorem or vice versa.

The package is dually licensed as LPPL or GPL.
