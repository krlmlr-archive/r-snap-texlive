What's this?
============

This directory contains a LaTeX2e package for an easy and NFSS2-compliant 
use of the eiad font family created by Ivan A Derzhanski under
LaTeX2e. 

Obviously Plain-TeX users, etc, cannot use this package, but they
should know how to load fonts with the \font-command anyhow...

What is NOT provided here?
==========================

The fonts themselves are NOT in this directory. You can find them on
CTAN in the directory tex-archive/fonts/eiad/, so for example in
	ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/eiad
or	ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/fonts/eiad
and mirrors of CTAN...

So you need the 6 *.mf-files contained in this place.

What IS provided here?
======================

There are two additional mf-files: 
	Fbf10.mf
	Fr10.mf
and two files to make the style file and the documentation:
	eiad.ins
	eiad.dtx
(and this file (README) of course...).

What are these files?
---------------------
In the documentation of the eiad-fonts there is described how to make
two additional mf-files. 
They are easy to produce, I admit, but this step might prevent someone
from using the eiad-fonts. And since I had to make these files for
using the fonts myself anyway, I think I should provide them here. So
I have done some of your work, made your life easier ;-) and I am using
7kB of CTAN space more...
In the 'Installation'-part of this document is described where to put
these files...

With the files eiad.* you can easily produce the style file and the
documentation, as described in the following...

Installation
============
It's easy. But I will explain it in full detail...

So you got the 6 *mf-files for the eiad-font-family created by  Ivan A
Derzhanski (see above for finding them, if you haven't), the two
*mf-files provided by me, eiad.ins and eiad.dtx. Good. 

In a TDS-conforming TeX-installation you now have to put the 8 *mf-files 
in the directory
	$TEXMF/fonts/source/public/eiad

If you have a TeX-installation which doesn't produce *tfm and
*pk-files on the fly, you have to produce them by hand.
On some TeX-installations (like teTeX, for example) there are some
map-files used by MakeTeX* for putting the produced *tfm and *pk-files
in the correct subdirectories.. So you should add 
-----------
@c Gaelic fonts: eiad font family
eiad10          public          eiad
eiadbf10        public          eiad
-----------
add the end of the file $TEXMF/fontname/special.map.

Now run the file eiad.ins through latex:
	latex eiad.ins
You get a file called 
	eiad.sty
Copy this in a TDS-conforming installation to 
	$TEXMF/macros/tex/latex/eiad/
or (since this is only one file) to
	$TEXMF/macros/tex/latex/misc/

If you use a database for finding your files (like ls-R in teTeX) you
have to update it now (e.g. run 'texhash' for teTeX). Do this first
because we already need eiad.sty for producing the documentation...

Now you can produce the documentation:
	latex eiad.dtx
If you want a change history in the docs, now run
	makeindex -s ...  -o eiad.gls eiad.glo
where ... means the full path for the file 'gglo.ist'. With teTeX 0.4
you can say 
	makeindex -s `kpsewhich tex gglo.ist` -o eiad.gls eiad
Then run the file twice through latex again:
	latex eiad.dtx
	latex eiad.dtx
The resulting file
	eiad.dvi
you can put in the TDS-conforming directory
	$TEXMF/doc/latex/eiad
or (since this is only one file) in
	$TEXMF/doc/latex/misc

Using the package
=================

To use the package you say 
	\usepackage{eiad}
in the preamble. The commands of this package are described in the
documentation (see the 'Installation'-part for getting the
documentation out of eiad.dtx.)
