 The documentation is in French.

B. Features

 -- You can specify which answers are correct and which are not.
 -- works with utf8 and pdflatex;
 -- allows to use 'longtable';
 -- makes automatically adjustment;
 -- generates a 'grid' that the students will have to fill in;
 -- generates a 'mask' with correct answers to print a slide.
