Description
----------

This is a fully reworked and completed release of opcit, the package
for footnote-style bibliography.

The package keeps track of what works have already been cited, so that
a further citation produces "Idem" or "op. cit." (both of which are
customizable, both globally and locally).

New features include a complete bst file; corrections or improvements
suggested by users of the first version; cross references between
entries and between footnotes; and more.


Installation
----------

The sty file should go in tex\latex\opcit
The bst file should go in bibtex\bst\opcit (or any other subdirectory
of bst, such as public)


Documentation
-------------

The user's manual is the pdf file. Running LaTeX on opcit.dtx produces
this plus commented code.
