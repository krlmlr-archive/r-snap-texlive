This archive contains all the examples of the documentation about tkz-base.

You need to compile a file with pdflatex to have in the same directory the file tkzbasepreamble.ltx. This file is present in the archive.

You can also find  Makefile in the archive. The way to use the Makefile is :

$ cd <path of the archive>
$ make
