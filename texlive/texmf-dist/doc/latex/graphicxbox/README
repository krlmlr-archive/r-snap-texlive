Then graphicxbox Package

This is a short package that provides two new commands \graphicxbox and
\fgraphicxbox, which are companion commands to \colorbox and \fcolorbox
of color.dtx, by D. P. Carlisle. The \graphicxbox inserts a graphical
image as a background rather than a background color, while \fgraphcxbox
does the same thing, but also draws a colored frame around the box.

The package is compatible with graphicxsp, for those who use Adobe
Distiller as the PDF creator.

Enjoy!

Now, I must get back to my retirement.
