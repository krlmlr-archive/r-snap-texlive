SUMMARY

The 'newenviron' package provides the commands \newenviron and
\renewenviron that can be used to define environments whose bodies
will be collected in the macros \envbody and \<env name>body. These
macros can used to apply some code to the environment body at invocation
time.

The user-defined environments can be mixed and nested to any depth,
both at definition and invocation times.

There also exist the commands \EveryBeginOfEnvironment and
\EveryEndOfEnvironment for adding code to the start or end of the
environment at invocation time.

See the accompanying example file 'newenviron-examples.tex'.
