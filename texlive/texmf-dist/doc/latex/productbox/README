Purpose:
     productbox.dtx   provides  a  style  file   for  typesetting  a
     three-dimensional product box. This product box can be rendered
     as it is standing on a surface and  some light is shed onto it.
     Alternatively  it can be typeset  as a wireframe  to be cut out
     and glued together. This will lead to a physical product box.

Documentation:
     The  documentation  can  be  generated  from the  original file
     productbox.dtx  with  the  doc  style/package.  LaTeX  the file    
     productbox.dtx to get the full documentation in pdf format. 

Prerequisite:
     This  package  needs  PGF and  TikZ  to be present  at least in
     version 2.0.
