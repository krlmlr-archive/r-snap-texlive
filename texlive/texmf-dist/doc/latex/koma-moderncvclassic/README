KOMA-MODERNCVCLASSIC v0.5
=========================
(License: LaTeX Project)

This package provides an imitation of the moderncv-class with the classic style (by Xavier Danaux), to be used in conjunction with the koma-classes (usually scrartcl).

Thus it is possible to configure pagelayout, headings etc. the way it is done in koma-classes. Moreover, it is possible to use biblatex, while the original moderncv-class is incompatible with biblatex. (This, actually, was the main reason for building this package.)

To be able to use the moderncvclassic-package:
* download the gzip-archive, 
* unpack it and 
* copy the file moderncvlassic.sty to your local tex-directory. 
* Run texhash on your local tex-directory.

With \usepackage{koma-moderncvlassic} the moderncvclassic definitions and commands become available in your document.

The cvbasic-file, which is included in the gzip-archive, shows exemplarily how a document with koma-moderncvclassic might be structured, which commands are available and how they are to be used. Things are self-explanatory, so there comes no documentation with this package.
The changelog-file contains the revision history and acknowledgements.

I hope you enjoy this package.
