This is the distribution of LaTeX CWEB, a bundle that allows you to
use LaTeX as the documentation markup of your CWEB program. Your CWEB
programs may be LaTeX documents now -- with sections, subsections,
environments, figures, graphics inclusion, etc.

You will want to use this bundle if you

 -- are a CWEB programmer and use LaTeX elsewhere,
 -- haven't used CWEB up to now, because you wanted structured markup
    (and you didn't want to develop it yourself), or
 -- want an hierarchic document structure for CWEB programs.

Included in the distribution is the full source and DVI files for your
convenience.
    In addition, the distribution features a well known example: the
``Counting Words'' program distributed with CWEB. I recoded it to
LaTeX markup. You'll find both source and processed files in the
examples/ directory.

Note that the style file is rather large because the comments are not
stripped yet. This will change in a future release. I'm still working
on this class, the next release will support inclusion of CWEB program
parts in other LaTeX documents. (Yes, I know that this was already
promised for this release. Look in src/ for a preliminary version, in
cwebparts.sty and cwebx.sty -- the end user documentation is missing
and it has lots of rough edges, but it works!)
    If you have more wishes or if you have any other gripes about the
usage of this class, you should send them *now*, as you can still
influence the development. When I've finished the realization of the
inclusion, I'll freeze the code base and will concentrate on fixes for
reported problems.

Anyhow, feedback is always appreciated, I'd like to know if you that
style. -- The more people tell me they use it, the more support I'll
put in future versions.


If you want to use this style file, you must use CWEB V3. (Current
release, as of $Date: 1995/11/21 00:41:49 $: 3.4.) You must also use a
more-or-less recent LaTeX2e, I cannot support LaTeX 2.09 any longer.
(`More-or-less recent' means: if I need a feature that was introduced
in the current LaTeX revision or in the previous one, I'll use it.)
Most probably you also need a big TeX to use the cweb class, but they
should be common by now anyhow.


MANIFEST features a list of files in this distribution.
For installation instructions, check the file INSTALL.
src/TODO explicates my development plans.
