You're not on Unix?  Jump ahead to `INSTALLATION BY HAND'.


INSTALLATION ON UNIX
====================

I have supplied a Makefile for your convenience. You have to edit it
to tell make where your TeX installation lives.

Do you have a TDS-compliant installation?
(E.g., teTeX, highly recommended.)

    yes => Change the value of TEXMF to your TDS root directory.
    no  => Change even more variables (the ones below TEXMF).
	   Make sure all parent directories exist.


Type
	make

Everything should be installed now.

If you have a TDS installation structure and make complains that the
LaTeX directory is not found, install LaTeX first.



INSTALLATION BY HAND
====================

Copy *.cls, *.sty, and contrib/*.sty to some directory where LaTeX finds it.
    The correct TDS directory name is tex/latex/cweb/, relative to the
    TDS root.

Copy *.dvi from the current directory to the directory
where you keep the documentation for your installed LaTeX styles.
    What? You don't have such a directory? Shame on you. ;-)
    The TDS proposes one of the following directory names: doc/latex/cweb/
    or doc/latex/styles/cweb/. I use the latter.
