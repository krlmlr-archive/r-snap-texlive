% This file is either a subdocument of the style doc or a document on
% its own. In the former case it's a chapter, in the latter it's a
% ``normal'' LaTeX progltx document.
%     If it's a subdocument, this file will be included after
% \begin{document}. We can detect this: \document redefines
% \documentclass to be \@twoclasseserror. Then we also have to define
% how this document is ended: Either by \endinput or by an additional
% revision log.
% Of course, this test works only if LaTeX 2e is used for processing.

shall describe the internal interface for \TeX{} programmers who want
to write packages or subclasses to enhance the \cls{cweb} class. In
particular, it shall describe all control sequences a programmer may
redefine to adapt this class to special needs. (There are an awful lot
of them, all cseqs that start with `|Cweb|'.)

Due to time constraints this description has not been written yet. It
depends on the demand when it will be written. I.e., if \emph{you} are
a package/class writer and if you want to enhance the \cls{cweb}
class, send me email. Please mention the kind of enhancement you want
to do. I will then add information to this description as needed.
