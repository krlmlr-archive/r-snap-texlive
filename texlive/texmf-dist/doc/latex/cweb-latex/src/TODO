functionality [problem]

In plain CWEB chunks are not split over pages, LaTeX CWEB does so. Add
an option that re-establishs the behaviour of plain CWEB.

Problem reported by Denis B. R\"ogel <denis.roegel@loria.fr>

----------------------------------------------------------------------

functionality [problem]

User index would use with standard LaTeX markup (\index) would use
*.idx as raw index file. This file is used by CWEAVE as tagged index
file.

Shall I redefine \makeindex?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

functionality [proposal]

Add support to create the illusion of more than one refinement in a
chunk.

\cwebNoChunkIntro; see cwebx.sty.
Proposed by Christopher Higgins <C.Higgins@cit.gu.edu.au>.
Ack him for that.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

functionality [proposal]

Add support for CWEB code examples.

For that code from cwebparts.doc must be moved to cwebbase.doc; see
cwebx.sty. That code has also several improvements over cwebparts.doc!
cwebparts.doc is needed later for typesetting sections, etc. Well, if
that can really be realized in a document/project independent way.
Don't know if I really need it. (Except as a user front end. But I
can also use cwebbase for that.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

functionality [proposal]

Add support for HyperTeX.

Proposed by Christopher Higgins <C.Higgins@cit.gu.edu.au>.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

list headers [error]

Use \chaptermark & \sectionmark, in \CwebListSection.

Maybe discard \@mkboth from \CwebIdIndex, \CwebRefList, etc. It's
supposed to be changed by a pagestyle, but this doesn't happen with
fancyheadings anyhow -- and face it, fancyheadings is the method of
choice for head-/footline creation.

The actual code was caused by stupid copying from LaTeX standard
classes; with the change it's possible to have other list heading
layout (add to toc, other marks, etc.)

But check if I can use that in \CwebIdIndex: There \CwebListSection is
used in an \twocolumn optional arg, that will eventually trigger the
output routine and will be set as a float. Does marks correctly
migrate out of floats?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

layout [error]

In chunks without documentation, a refinement is too near to the chunk
marker. In addition, the distance is not independent of
\CwebIndentUnit, making it impossible to change the latter.

NOTE: Might be a problem of \cwebNoChunk that should start a
paragraph. *When* will CWEAVE add `\4' after `\B'? Have to make tests
for that. How can I detect an empty documentation section?

\B kind of repaired in cwebx.sty.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

layout [error]

Chunk numbers are not exactly aligned in all circumstances, see fixme
remark in cwebbase.doc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

interface [idea]

Name all \cwbb@... macros used in other modules \Cwbb... (or even
\cwbb...).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

markup [proposal]

Support delimiting section titles by braces.

Maybe one needs an option to turn that on.

Supported by Peter Wainwright <prw-b@ugrad.cs.york.ac.uk>.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

documentation [ack]

Who sent the mail concerning \hb@xt@? Add to acks. Change log message
for it, too (cweb.doc: 3.4; cwebbase.doc: 1.4).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

documentation [problem]

cweb-conf.tex:

Cseq name of chunk marker (paragraph symbol).
Ack Christopher Higgins \path|<c.higgins@cit.gu.edu.au>|.

\CwebRankNoEject. (Implies explication of rank numbers. Should be
explicated in cwebbase.doc as well, btw.)
Ack Nicholas Urbanik \path|<nicku@iohk.com>|

Support for another language must be stored in cwbl-*.sty. Check
cwbl-german.sty for the cseqs that must be redefined, list their
original English text for clarification.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

distribution [problem]

cweb.cls & cwebbase.tex is > 100KB now. Export it in uncommented form.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

distribution [problem]

It's better to collect stuff from contrib, and have each file that
shall be installed in top dir.

This means a Makefile in contrib/; and changes in README, INSTALL, and
maybe even MANIFEST.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

distribution [proposal]

Add hint to TODO in README. Maybe point out that src/ sometimes holds
prereleases of future styles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

distribution [proposal]

Install TODO in doc dir. The end user should see open problems and
plans, too.
