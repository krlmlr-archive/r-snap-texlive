COPYRIGHT 1993, by Timothy Van Zandt

DESCRIPTION:

  seminar.sty is a LaTeX document style for typesetting slides or
  transparencies, and accompanying notes. It has many advantages over
  SliTeX. Here are some of the style's special features:
   *  It is a LaTeX style, rather than another format.
   *  It is compatible with AmS-LaTeX.
   *  You can use any fonts that work with LaTeX, including PostScript
      fonts and AmSFonts.
   *  Slides can be landscape and portrait within the same file.
   *  Color is supported through PostScript.
   *  The slides can have a frame and a colored background.
   *  The magnification can be changed with a single command.
   *  Overlays can be produced from a single slide environment.
   *  Accompanying notes, such as the text of a presentation, can be put
      outside the slide environments. The slides, notes or both together
      can then be typeset in a variety of formats.
  Some of these features require a PostScript output device.

GETTING STARTED:

  1. Put the input files in a directory where your TeX looks for inputs.

  2. Typeset and print sem-user.tex.

  3. Read the preface "Getting Started", and then the appendices.

  4. Typeset semsamp1.tex and semsamp2.tex.

  5  If upgrading from v0.92, see the changes listed at the end of this
     file. If upgrading from v0.91 or earlier, good luck.

HACKERS:

  The files seminar.doc, semlayer.doc and xcomment.doc contain the
  documented code, using Frank Mittelbach's doc system.
  See sem-code.tex and xcomment.tex for instructions on typesetting
  these files.
  See sem-make.tex and xc-make.tex for instruction on extracting
  stripped input (.sty) files from these .doc files.

MORE ABOUT THE SUPPLEMENTAL STYLES AND MACROS:

  The following styles and macros are not specifically for use
  with seminar.sty, and hence are not described in detail in
  the seminar.sty User's Guide. You do not need to read the
  documentation of these files in order to use seminar.sty.
  If you have versions on your system that are older than the
  ones distributed with seminar.sty, be sure to replace these.

  FANCYBOX.STY:
  fancybox.sty is a LaTeX style option with tips and tricks for LR-box
  commands. The documentation, fancybox.doc, is extensive.

  2UP.TEX:
  2up.tex/2up.sty contains macros for typesetting documents in a
  two-up format. seminar.sty's \twoup command provides an interface.
  2up.doc is the documentation for 2up.tex.

  NPSFONT.STY:
  npsfont.sty contains macros for defining new PostScript fonts
  with the New Font Selection Scheme. The documentation is in
  npsfont.sty itself.

  XCOMMENT.STY:
  xcomment.sty, a LaTeX style option, permits one to typeset only
  selected environments, omitting input outside these environments.
  See xcomment.tex if you want to typeset the documentation.

  SLIDESEC.STY
  slidesec.sty is an experimental file contains sectioning commands
  for slide type documents. The documentation is in slidesec.sty
  itself.


SEMINAR.STY AND PSTRICKS.TEX:

  pstricks.tex is a collection of PostScript macros that is compatible
  with most TeX macro packages, including Plain TeX and LaTeX. Included are
  macros for color, graphics, rotation, overlays, nodes and much more.

  seminar.sty, combined with the semcolor option, the PSTricks package,
  and your favorite macros for including EPS files, make a complete
  TeX presentation software package.

  You can probably obtain the PSTricks package from wherever you got
  the Seminar package, or try
    Princeton.EDU:/pub or Princeton.EDU:/pub/tvz

  You must install the PSTricks package before using the semcolor option.

  seminar.sty will work with pstricks.tex v0.92, and maybe later
  versions.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

 The author is thankful to Frank Mittelbach for his documentation system.

 Thanks to Sebastian Rahtz for bits of advice, and many users for
 comments and bug reports.

BUGS:

  Too many to list, and who knows what they are anyway. These files are all
  preliminary and unstable. Not responsible for neck injuries.


  Thanks.

CHANGES:

  v1.0: Included sem-a4.sty file, as a way to let the default papersize
     be A4 (The a4 option still works). Added \epsfslidesize to make
     it easier to set the slide of eps files with epsf.sty. Fixed bug
     which caused the width of second pages of a multi-page slide to
     end up too small if the page only contained a quote or similar
     environment with reduced margins.

  v0.93a: Fixed bugs so that slides would come out properly with the
          2-up,article and portrait options (together), and so that
          slides would be positioned correctly with the portrait style
          option.

  v0.93:

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:

    !  Use the a4 option instead of sem-a4. There is not longer a
       separate file for a4.

    !  No more \fewnotes, \nonotes. Use \slideplacement instead.

    !  No more \layerstyle, \overlaystyle.

    !  Slide styles are now "left" and "bottom".

    !  No more \ifslides. Use \ifarticle\else.

    !  You must now use the semlayer option to use overlays (in addition
      to the semcolor option).

    !  No "down" slide rotation (only "none", "left" and "right".

    !  portrait option is no longer a separate file.

    !  \paperwidth and \paperheight are now ordinary commands, to be set
      with \renewcommand.

    !  \slidefonts is now always invoked in slide environments, and never in
      the preamble. (But semhelv.sty and semlcmss.sty have changed to
      reflect this.)

    !  Method for customizing the slide frames has changed.
       \slideframecolor, \slideframearc, \slidefillcolor and
       \slideshadowcolor are obsolete.

    ! \landscape command replaced by \printlandscape to avoid conflict with
      other style files. (E.g., \def\printlandscape{\special{landscape}}).

  NEW FEATURES:

    +  A slide environment can have multiple `pages'. \extraslideheight{len}
      controls page cutting. See user's guide for details.

    +  \centerslidestrue (default) causes the contents of partially full
      slides to be vertically centered in the slide. \centerslidesfalse
      causes it to be flush top.

    +  New \raggedslides[len] command, for setting
      whether right margin in slides is ragged or justified. Default is
      \raggedslides. \raggedslides[0pt] gives justified slides.

    +  \slideplacement

    +  \onlynotestoo

    +  \slideskip and \slideshrink for added control over interline space.


    +  New: \slideleftmargini, \slideleftmarginii, \slideleftmarginiii,
      \slidelabelsep, \slideitemsep, \slidepartopsep,
      \slideparskip, \slideparindent, \slidefootins, \slidefootnotesep,
      \slidedisplayskips, \theslidefootnote

    +  \input and \endinput now supported for the slidesonly selection.

    +  New conditional: \ifportrait

    +  \newslideframe

    +  \leftsliderotation, \rightsliderotation.

    +  New \slidetopmargin, \slidebottommargin, \slideleftmargin,
       \sliderightmargin.

    +  New notesonly* selection.

    +  New \slidesclearpagetrue

    +  New \semcm and \semin.

    +  New note environment and \noxcomment command, as an alternative
       to treating everything outside slide environments as notes.


  BACKWARDS-COMPATIBLE CHANGES:

    *  \maketitle now uses LaTeX's default from article.sty in notes.

    *  Bug in article option with the \twoup command fixed.

    *  \topmargin in sem-a4 changed from -.75in to 1in.

    *  \slidefontsizes is obsolete (but still works). Use \ptsize instead.

    *  Page parameters are now in a separate file sem-page.sty. sem-a4.sty
      has been changed to reflect this.

  v0.92:
    Mostly bug fixes, plus some extra options. The PSTricks package
    is no longer distributed with seminar.sty.

  Pre v0.91:
    Entirely rewritten. Too many changes to list. Note especially
    that system of formats and selections has changed.

BUGS: If you have problems using this seminar package with LaTeX2e,
      report them to Timothy.VAN-ZANDT@insead.edu. The problem probably lies
      with seminar.cls. You can probably continue to use the seminar
      package with LaTeX2e in compatibility mode, while waiting for a bug
      fix, by renaming seminar.cls to something else.

ABOUT V1.0e:

  The V1.0e distribution is identical to v1.0 of 93/04/01,
  except for a few changes so that Seminar can work with
  NFSS2 and LaTeX2e:

   - semhelv.sty and semlcmss.sty have been modified to work
     with NFSS2 and LaTeX2e (but they still work with NFSS).

   - seminar.cls has been added. This is a LaTeX2e document class,
     derived from seminar.sty v1.0 by Sebastian Rahtz.

  If you already have have seminar.sty v1.0e, then all you need
  are this read-me file plus these files from the inputs
  directory:

    seminar.cls semhelv.sty semlcmss.sty

USING SEMINAR WITH LATEX2E:

  !!! YOU MUST BE USING A LATEX2E RELEASED AFTER 19 FEBRUARY 1994

  You can either use seminar.sty in compatibility mode:
    \documentstyle{seminar}
  Or use the seminar.cls document class:
    \documentclass{seminar}

  Unless you are using other macros that only work in
  compatibility mode, you might as well use the document class.

  You can use the following options with \documentclass{seminar}:

    article  slidesonly  notes  notesonly  notesonly*
    noxcomment  portrait  a4 (or a4paper) semhelv semlcmss
    semlayer semrot semcolor slidesec
  
  plus appropriate options for the article document class
  (e.g., 11pt)

  NOTE: Use `a4' or `a4paper', not `sem-a4'.

  `seminar.cls' is a minimal modification of seminar.sty. The
  next release will take advantage of more of LaTeX2e's special
  capabilities.
