F W L W . S T Y  (First Word, Last Word)
Donald Arseneau  (1993, 1995)

  The fwlw package provides a mechanism to determine the first and
  last words on the current page, plus the first word on the *next*
  page.  These can be used in head-lines or foot-lines.  The `words'
  you see may not be real words, but any unbreakable object.
