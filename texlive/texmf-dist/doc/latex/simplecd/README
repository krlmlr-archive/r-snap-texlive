The simplecd package

The simplecd package provides printable cut-outs for various CD, DVD and other data storage holders.
The name of the package comes form it's implementation and ease of use.

The simplecd package was created for producing cut-outs for creating covers, inlays(inlets) for 
optical disc packaging such as jewel cases, keepcases. Additional data storage cover support were added for
VHS, audio cassette and gramophone records. The covers were aimed for containing only 
simple text with different font sizes, but since everything is placed inside a \parbox environment, it can
contain a wide range of things.

There are also macros which can resize ready-to-print images to the appropriate size.
