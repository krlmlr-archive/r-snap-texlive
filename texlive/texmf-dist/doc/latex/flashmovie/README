This package allows direct embedding of flash movies into PDF files. It is
designed for use with pdflatex.

Basically it uses the fact that the Adobe Reader 9 contains
an embedded Adobe Flash player which can be invoked with the
"rich media annotation" feature which is described  in
"Adobe Supplement to the ISO 32000 BaseVersion: 1.7
ExtensionLevel: 3".

advantages:
  - You can directly embed videos into the pdf (external window is optimal 
    and not necessary).
  - You can play back videos without worrying about platform dependencies.

disadvantages:
  - You can only play back embedded videos with Adobe Reader 9 and upwards.
