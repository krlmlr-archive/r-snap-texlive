The Typeface Package v0.1 (2012/05/28) Prerelease - release for review
======================================================================

The typeface package provides a relatively easy-to-use facility for
setting up default roman, sans serif, typewriter, math, symbols and
lining/text figures Type1 fonts in LaTeX documents. Its purpose is to
make it easy to choose, mix and match fonts from among the main Type1
font sets available at CTAN. Other Type1 fonts can be readily
incorporated into typeface package management by modifying the provided
configuration file.

Ignoring the typographic dubiousness of this example, the following code
will initialise \rmdefault to the light, old style figures variant of KP
Fonts, \sfdefault to Helvetica, and \ttdefault to Luxi Mono typewriter.
Math fonts will be initialised to Math Design with Charter text. In the
process, math fonts and Helvetica will be automatically scaled to the
ex-height of KP Fonts. Luxi Mono will be scaled to 90% of its design
size.

  \useackage[typeface=kpfonts:light,
             sanstypeface=helvetica,
             monotypeface=luxi:scale:0.9,
             textfigures=oldstylefigures,
             mathtypeface=mathdesign:charter,
            ]{typeface}
