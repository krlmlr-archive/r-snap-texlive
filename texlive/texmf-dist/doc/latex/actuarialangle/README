AUTHOR

The code in this package was given to me (Vincent Goulet
<vincent.goulet@act.ulaval.ca>) by a former colleague who would simply
copy it in the preamble of all his documents needing an "angle"
symbol. The actual author of the code is unknown.

My sole contribution was to make a package out of the code.

USAGE

Copy the package file "where LaTeX can find it", then

  \usepackage{actuarialangle}

and (in math mode)

  \actuarialangle{n}

to typeset "angle n". For a complete present value symbol, use
something like 

  a_{\actuarialangle{n}}

SHORTCUTS

You will most likely want to use the following shortcuts:

\angl  for \actuarialangle
\angln for \angl{n}
\anglr for \angl{r}
