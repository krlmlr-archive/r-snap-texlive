ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide
federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work
of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through
ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for
which a technical committee has been established has the right to be
represented on that committee. International organizations,
governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part
in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical
standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given
in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part~2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards.
Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are
circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75\% of the member
bodies casting a vote.
