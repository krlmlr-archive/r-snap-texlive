    The iso class is for typesetting ISO International Standard documents
according to the requirements specified in "ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2,
Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards.
(Fourth edition, 2001)". Configuration files for TeX4ht are also provided.

Changes in the 2002 release
o Updated from ISO/IEC Directives, Third edition, 1997 to the 
  Fourth edition, 2001.

    The distribution is under the LPPL and consists of the following files:
README (this file)
isoe.dtx
isoe.ins
isoe.pdf
iso4ht.dtx
iso4ht.ins
iso4ht.pdf
isoman.tex
isoman.pdf (user manual)

  To install the class (and packages)
o run: latex isoe.ins (which will generate *.cls, *.clo, *.sty and *.tex files)
o Move the generated files to a location where LaTeX will find them
  (if you don't know where this is, see the FAQ on CTAN in /help/uktug-faq)

o To regenerate the commented source code
  o run: latex isoe.dtx
  o run: makeindex -s gind.ist isoe
  o run: latex isoe.dtx
  o print isoe.dvi for a hardcopy
o For the User Manual, either latex isoman.tex or print isoman.pdf 

o If you might use TeX4ht (and this might well not work):
  o run: latex iso4ht.dtx (which will generate *.4ht file(s))
  o To print the commented source code, follow instructions above on iso4ht.dtx
  o Move the generated *.4ht file(s) to a location where TeX4ht will find them

    Don't forget to update the (La)TeX file database if you have one.
