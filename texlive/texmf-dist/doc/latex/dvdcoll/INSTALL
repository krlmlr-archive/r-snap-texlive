  dvdcoll -- INSTALL
======================

All the files ending with .cls, .sty, .bst and .dcl have to be installed where
TeX can find them. Please refer to your TeX distribution's manual for how
to install additional packages.

According to the TeX Directory Standard (TDS), the files should be installed
in your local texmf/ tree as follows:

-- *.cls -> localtexmf/tex/latex/dvdcoll/
-- *.sty -> localtexmf/tex/latex/dvdcoll/
-- *.dcl -> localtexmf/tex/latex/dvdcoll/dcl/
-- *.bst -> localtexmf/bibtex/bst/dvdcoll/
-- *.pdf -> localtexmf/doc/latex/dvdcoll/
-- *.tex -> localtexmf/doc/latex/dvdcoll/

Don't forget to update your FNDB (Filename database). (see: manual)
