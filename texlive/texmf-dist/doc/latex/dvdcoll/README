Having lost the overview of my DVD archives, I simply could not remember 
if I already recorded the documentary running on TV that day. I chose to 
recreate the index using LaTeX: the design aim was a hyperlinked and fully 
searchable PDF-document listing my DVDs with all titles, contents, lengths
and so on. Further requirements were support for seasons of tv series and
a list with all faulty or missing programs for rerecording. The dvdcoll
class supports all these requirements.

dvdcoll.cls follows the structure <number><title><length>. As a result, 
the class is not limited to DVDs - you can of course typeset archives of
CD-ROMs, Audio-CDs and so on.

Supported languages at the moment: English, French, German, Italian, Polish,
Portuguese, Spanish.

Some help is needed for other languages! ;-)
