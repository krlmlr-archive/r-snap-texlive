* Description
=============

The FigSize package enables automatic sizing of graphics,
especially when including graphics with the graphicx package.  The
user only has to specify the number of graphics that should fit to
a page or fraction there of and the package will dynamically
calculate the correct graphics sizes relative to the page size.
Thus, graphics can be auto-sized to fill a whole page or fraction
and manual changes of graphic sizes are never needed when changing
document layouts!  Finally, the package's dynamic lengths can be
used to allow other document element sizes to be dynamic.

* Changes
