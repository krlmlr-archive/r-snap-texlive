Description:
------------
The cleveref package enhances LaTeX's cross-referencing features, allowing the
format of cross-references to be determined automatically according to the
"type" of cross-reference (equation, section, etc.) and the context in which
the cross-reference is used. The formatting for each cross-reference type can
be fully customised in the preamble of your document. In addition, cleveref
can type-set cross-references to lists of multiple labels, automatically
formatting them according to their types, sorting them, and compressing
sequences of numerically consecutive labels. Again, the multiple-reference
formatting is fully customisable. Though a number of other packages provide
similar features, all have certain deficiencies which cleveref attempts to
overcome.

Using cleveref is easy. Basically, wherever you would previously have used
\ref, you can use \cref instead. (Except at the beginning of a sentence, where
you should use \Cref.)  You no longer need to put the name of the thing you're
referencing in front of the \cref command, because cleveref will sort that out
for you: i.e. use "\cref{eq1}" instead of "eq.~(\ref{eq1})". If you want to
refer to a range of labels, use the \crefrange command: "\crefrange{eq1}{eq5}"
produces "eqs.~(1) to~(5)". Finally, if you want to refer to multiple things
at once, you can now combine them all into one cross-reference and leave
cleveref to sort it out: e.g. "\cref{eq2,eq1,eq3,eq5,thm2,def1}" produces:
"eqs.~(1) to~(3) and~(5), theorem~5, and definition~1".

Cleveref has various other useful features. For details, see the package
documentation.
