This is the 'directory 1.20' distribution.

'directory' is a macro package for LaTeX and BibTeX that facilitates
the construction, the maintenance and the exploitation of an address
book like database.

Files included:

  README
  address-html.bst
  address-ldif.bst
  address-vcard.bst
  address.bst
  birthday.bst
  business.bib
  directory.pdf
  directory.ps
  directory.sty
  directory.tex
  email-html.bst
  email.bst
  family.bib
  letter.bst
  phone.bst

To rebuild the user's guide (directory.ps or directory.pdf), you must
run LaTeX, run BibTeX and then run LaTeX twice on the file
'directory.tex'.

Enjoy!
