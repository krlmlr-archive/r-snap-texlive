v0.2 2012-10-30

    `monofill.sty' addresses horizontal alignment with plain 
    text as in the result of LaTeX's \listfiles for plain text 
    output. v0.2 in fact provides a tool for use with the 
    `hardwrap' package that addresses console output: an 
    "other" "blank token" as "filling element", "\MFotherspace".

v0.1 2012-03-19

    `monofill.sty' addresses horizontal alignment with plain
    text as in the result of LaTeX's \listfiles, extending the
    `longnamefilelist' package for ideas by Martin Muench. 
    It may also be useful for alignment in typesetting 
    monospaced characters as in figure tables, for simulating 
    a typewriter, or for code listings. The implementation 
    also has "philosophical aspects," avoiding use of a counter 
    register.
