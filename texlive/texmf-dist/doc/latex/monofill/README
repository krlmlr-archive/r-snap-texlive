     "Alignment with Plain Text or Monospaced Characters"

                  (C) Uwe Lueck 2012/10/30


`monofill.sty' addresses horizontal alignment with plain text 
as in the result of LaTeX's \listfiles. In the first instance, 
it has been developed as the shared tool to adjust each column 
with the `nicefilelist' package. It may also be useful for 
alignment in typesetting monospaced characters as in figure 
tables, for simulating a typewriter, or for code listings. 
v0.2 in fact provides a tool for use with the `hardwrap' 
package that in turn has been made for console output. 
The implementation also has "philosophical aspects" in 
avoiding use of a counter register.
