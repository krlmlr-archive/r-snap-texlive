\section*{Example for morefloats}
\markboth{Example for morefloats}{Example for morefloats}

This example demonstrates the use of package\newline
\textsf{morefloats}, v1.0f as of 2012/01/28 (HMM; DH).\newline
The package takes options (here: \verb|maxfloats=19| is used).\newline
For more details please see the documentation!\newline

To reproduce the\newline
\texttt{\LaTeX{} Error: Too many unprocessed floats},\newline
comment out the \verb|\usepackage...| in the preamble
(line~3)\newline
(by placing a \% before it).\newline

\bigskip

Save per page about $200\unit{ml}$~water, $2\unit{g}$~CO$_{2}$
and $2\unit{g}$~wood:\newline
Therefore please print only if this is really necessary.\newline
I do NOT think, that it is necessary to print THIS file, really!

There follow a lot of floating tables.
