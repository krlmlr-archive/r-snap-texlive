The newunicodechar lets you define more friendly the meaning
of Unicode characters; it requires that the document is
processed by (pdf)LaTeX with \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
or by XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX: it provides the syntax

\newunicodechar{<char>}{<code>}

where <char> is some (directly typed in) Unicode character
and <code> is what we need to be substituted to <char>.

This is version 1.1 of the package

Changes from version 1.0:
o The inputenx package is supported
