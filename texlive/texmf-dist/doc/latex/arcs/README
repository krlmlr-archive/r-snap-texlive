This tiny package provides two commands for placing an arc
over/under a short piece of text.

The code comes from my package `metre'. I have repackaged it
to make it more easily available and to allow the commands
to be used within math formulas.

To install the package:
                         latex arcs.ins
                         latex arcs.dtx

The file arcstest.tex contains some examples of usage.
