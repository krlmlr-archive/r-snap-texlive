Abstract

The facsimile package provides a simple interface for creating a fax.
This covers by and large two areas: First, a title page is created with
a detailed fax header.  And secondly, every page gets headers and
footers so that the recipient can be sure to have received all pages and
complete pages, and to have the correct order.

Supported languages: Afrikaans, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian,
Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish.


Files

README          This file.
facsimile.dtx   Documentation and code for facsimile.cls.
facsimile.ins   Installation script.
facsimile.pdf   Ready-to-print package manual.


Installation

1) tex facsimile.ins
     unpacks `facsimile.cls' and the example files `fac-en.cfg',
     `fac-de.cfg', and `example.tex' from facsimile.dtx.

2) Edit `facsimile.cfg'
     if you need to set your default options.  You may use `fac-en.cfg'
     or `fac-de.cfg' as your starting point.

3) Copy facsimile.cls and facsimile.cfg
     into a directory searched by LaTeX.


Documentation

The package contains the manual `facsimile.pdf'. So you don't have to
make the manual, but you can remake it. To create the same manual, type

        pdflatex facsimile.dtx      
        pdflatex facsimile.dtx      
	makeindex -s gind facsimile.idx
        pdflatex facsimile.dtx      

(or simply "latex facsimile.dtx" to get a DVI file).  To create the full
documentation with the code description, first add a percent sign at the
beginning of the line

       \OnlyDescription

in `facsimile.dtx'.
