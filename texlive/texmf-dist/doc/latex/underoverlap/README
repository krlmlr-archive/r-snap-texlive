===== Prerequisites =====

To use this package, you need at least the following packages
installed:

* etoolbox
* mathtools
* xparse

===== Installation =====

underoverlap.sty is provided directly in the package archive. Put
it in a place where your LaTeX distribution can find it.

(underoverlap.sty is not generated, but manually maintained; you
 may use docstrip to remove the documentation, but you don't
 have to; it will just work the way it is)

===== Documentation =====

underoverlap.pdf is provided directly in the package archive. To
generate the documentation yourself, run LaTeX on underoverlap.tex.

(underoverlap.tex does not contain the package code itself; it inputs
 underoverlap.sty directly to document the implementation)
