This collection of files contains a LaTeX package for sections
surrounded by fancy boxes, primarily intended for use within posters
(e.g. made with sciposter.cls). A (pdf) manual is included as well.

NOTE that this version does work for LaTeX, not just pdfLaTeX.
However, due to the use of colour boxes xdvi produces strange results,
though a recent version of dvips does create good ps-files from the
dvi files.

An example can be found in the example directory.
