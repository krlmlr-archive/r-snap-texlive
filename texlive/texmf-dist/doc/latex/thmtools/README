    The \thmtools\ bundle provides several packages for commonly-needed 
    features for theorems. As designed, the bundle should work with kernel
    theorems, the theorem package and the amsthm package.
    
    WARNING: Currently, things might still be a bit rough. You
    might want to consider not relying on \thmtools\ for your Ph.D. thesis
    masterpiece.
    
Provided features:
a keyval interface to \newtheorem
a \listoftheorem command
hyperref/autoref compatibility
a way of restating entire theorems with a single macro call
