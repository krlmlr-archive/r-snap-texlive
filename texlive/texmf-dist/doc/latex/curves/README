The CURVES package version 1.53 of 2009/08/31.

DESCRIPTION

Draws curves in the LaTeX 2e picture environment using parabolic arcs
between data points with continuous slope at joins.  For circles and
circular arcs uses up to 16 parabolic arcs. Also draws symbols or dash
patterns along curves. A straight side switch changes curves to
polygons.  Extends picture capability without extra programs and data
files.  Parabolic arcs consist of short chords drawn by overlapping
disks or line drawing `\special's selected by package options.

INSTALLATION

If your LaTeX system is comprehensive curves.sty may already be
installed.  Download `curves.dtx' and run

  $ latex curves.dtx

If you get the error message:

  ! LaTeX Error: File `curves.sty' not found.	

curves is not installed.  If you get messages about `\straighttrue'
undefined you need to upgrade `curves.sty'.  If LaTeX stops processing
with anything else press `s' then `Enter'.

Use the following if you wish to install or upgrade `curves.sty'.
Download `curves.ins' and run

  $ latex curves.ins

which will generate `curves.sty' and `curvesls.sty' from `curves.dtx'.
To install curves you need to put `curves.sty' on your TeX search path
as root or administrator and run `mktexlsr' or equivalent to update
the TeX file databases.

Download and read `curves.pdf' for instructions and simple examples.
