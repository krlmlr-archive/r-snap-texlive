Edmargin provides a very simple design for critical editions.  There are
predefined endnote sections for textual notes, explanatory notes and 
emendations. Markers in the text may be either traditional footnote marks 
(distinctive for each series) or marginal references to the page in the 
endnotes section where the comment is to be found. Endnotes can be set 
either as individual notes or as block paragraphs (for cases in which 
there are many small notes). Endnote sections have headers of the form 
"Textual notes to pp. xx--yy." New endnote sections can be defined on the 
fly.
