The Pigpen Cipher is a simple substitution cipher originally used by Freemasons.
It is also known as masonic cipher, and was in fairly wide use in the 18th
century, for writing personal notes as well as complete books. It does not
provide any meaningful protection against cryptanalysis, though. Today
it is still used by schoolchildren.

The pigpen cipher package provides the font and the necessary wrappers
(style file, etc.) in order to write Pigpen ciphers.
