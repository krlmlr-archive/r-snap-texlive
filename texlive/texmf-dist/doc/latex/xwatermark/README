SUMMARY

This package puts user-specified watermarks (graphics and arbitrary
texts) on select pages of documents. It is more general than the
packages 'draftwatermark', 'watermark', 'draftmark', 'wallpaper' and
similar packages. The advantages of xwatermark over these packages
include: the user can specify the watermark and color, the watermark
position and orientation, the page(s) (all pages, odd pages, even pages,
a particular page number, and a range of pages) on which the watermark
should appear, and all the options are passed directly to package instead
of being defined by macros. Also, multiple text and/or picture watermarks
(or wallpapers) can be put on the same page or range of pages with
little effort.

Among other macros, there are the macros \newwatermark and
\newwallpaper, both of which can be used to dynamically specify
watermark properties for each page or range of pages. With the
'xcolor' package (not loaded by this package), all colors and
those defined within the user document can be passed to this package.
