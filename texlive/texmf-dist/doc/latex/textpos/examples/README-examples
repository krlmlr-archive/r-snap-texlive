The t?.tex files in this directory are intended as regression tests,
rather than strictly as examples.  They nonetheless serve to illustrate
some of what textpos can do.

Not all of them actually work, as regression tests, right now, but
this is because when comparing binary formats such as .dvi files,
it's not always completely obvious what counts as a significant
change.  Any comments and suggestions would be welcome.
