etaremune v1.2
--------------

This package implements the etaremune environment which is similar
to the enumerate environment, except that labels are decreasing
instead of increasing. This package provides an alternative to the
revnum package which uses a lot of counters. The style of lists
can be controlled locally and globally. See for more information
the pdf documentation of this package.


Installation
------------

First check whether this package can be installed by the
distribution that you use, since that will simplify installation.
For manual installations, the structure and supposed location in a
TDS compliant TeX-tree is shown in the overview below. In words,
etaremune.sty should be available to LaTeX. Don't forget to update
your filename database after installing the files.

CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/etaremune: official location

 |- readme       : should not be installed
 |- etaremune.dtx: /source/latex/etaremune
 |- etaremune.pdf: /doc/latex/etaremune
 `- etaremune.sty: /tex/latex/etaremune

The package includes pregenerated run and doc files, but you can
reproduce them from the source if necessary. See the first lines of
etaremune.dtx for information how to do this.

See the documentation of your LaTeX distribution or the TeX
