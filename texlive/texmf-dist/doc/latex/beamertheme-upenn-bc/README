This is a LaTeX beamer-theme in the colors of the
- University of Pennsylvania, USA (beamercolorthemepenn.sty), and 
- Boston College, USA (beamercolorthemegoeagles.sty).
Both were tested for the presentation theme ``Warsaw''.

Please note that these color themes are neither official nor exact! The colors are approximated from the universities' style guidelines and websites, and slightly modified where necessary to generate an appealing look. The universities neither endorse, nor provide any support for, these color themes. I give no warranty for the code. 

------------
Installation 
------------
1) Move the files beamercolorthemepenn.sty and beamercolorthemegoeagles.sty into a global or local directory which is searched by tex, ideally in the beamer tree. For example, move the folder ``color'' to 
C:\TeX\MiKTeX 2.9\tex\latex\beamer\base\themes\ 
or to a new folder like
C:\TeX\MiKTeX 2.9\tex\latex\beamer\themes\.
2) Then run the MiKTeX settings application and update the formats and file name database (FNDB).

-----
Usage
-----
Add \usepackage{goeagles} or \usepackage{penn} after loading the beamer package and the Warsaw theme to your TeX file.
