graphbox v1.0
Copyright 2013-2014 Niklas Beisert

graphbox is an extension for the LaTeX2e package 
graphicx to facilitate the placement of graphics
relative to the current position
using additional optional arguments [...]
of \includegraphics. 
For example, changing the vertical alignment is convenient 
for using graphics as elements of (mathematical) formulae. 
Options for shifting, smashing and hiding the graphics 
are mainly intended for designing presentations using, 
e.g., the beamer framework.

The package consists of the files 

    README        readme file
    graphbox.ins  installation file
    graphbox.dtx  source file
    graphbox.sty  package file
    gboxsamp.tex  sample latex file
    gboxsamp.mps  sample graphics file
    graphbox.pdf  manual

The distribution consists of the files README, graphbox.ins and graphbox.dtx.

Run "(pdf)latex graphbox.dtx" to compile the manual graphbox.pdf.

Run "tex graphbox.ins" to create the package graphbox.sty and the sample gboxsamp.tex.
Copy the file graphbox.sty to an appropriate directory of your LaTeX
distribution, e.g. texmf-root/tex/latex/graphbox.
