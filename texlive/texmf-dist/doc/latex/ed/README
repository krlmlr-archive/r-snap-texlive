Ed.sty: Editorial Notes for LaTeX Documents

This package defines a couple of editorial notes that simplify collaboration on a LaTeX
text. These allow authors to annotate status information in the source. In draft mode, the
annotations are shown for communication, and in publication mode these are suppressed.
