       FONTS  CRYST
       to produce the graphical symbols for
       symmetry elements in crystallography
       ------------------------------------

Description
===========

The files cryst.mf, cryst.tfm, cryst.afm, and cryst.pfb produce the
graphical symbols used in crystallography to designate symmetry
elements such as rotation axes, screw axes etc. (cf. International
Tables for Crystallography, Volume A).

cryst1.pdf contains a description (in German) and a listing of the
symbols.


Installation
============

cryst.mf contains the METAFONT file to produce the pk files.
cryst.afm and cryst.pfb contain the PostScript Type 1 fonts
(for PostScript or pdf output).

Create a new subdirectory cryst1 in your directory of the tfm (tex font
metrics) files (e.g. \texmf\fonts\tfm\public\cryst1 for MikTex
under Windows or /usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/cryst1 for Linux RedHat).
Copy cryst.tfm into this directory.

Create a new subdirectory cryst1 in your directory of METAFONT files
(e.g. \texmf\fonts\source\public\cryst1
or /usr/share/texmf/fonts/source/cryst1).
Copy cryst.mf into this directory.

Create a new subdirectory cryst1 in your directory of afm (Type 1) files
(e.g. \texmf\fonts\afm\cryst1 or /usr/share/texmf/fonts/afm/cryst1).
Copy cryst.afm into this directory.

Create a new subdirectory cryst1 in your directory of pfb (Type 1) files
(e.g. \texmf\fonts\type1\cryst1 or /usr/share/texmf/fonts/type1/cryst1).
Copy cryst.pfb into this directory.

Tell dvips (for PostScript output) where to find the files.
To this end, insert the following line into the file config.ps:
p +cryst1.map
(config.ps is in a directory like \texmf\dvips\config
or /usr/share/texmf/dvips/config).
If you use pdfTeX, insert
map +cryst1.map
to your pdftex.cfg file
(in \texmf\pdftex\config or /usr/share/texmf/pdftex/config).

Create a new file cryst1.map in a new subdirectory of the directory
of map files (e.g. \texmf\dvips\cryst1 or /usr/share/texmf/dvips/cryst1).
The file cryst1.map consists of one line:
cryst cryst1 <cryst.pfb

Finally, tell TeX which new files and directories exist. This is done
by a command like
initexmf -u  for MikTeX under Windows
or run texhash under root in the shell of Linux RedHat.


Usage
=====

Include the following commands in the preamble of your document:

\DeclareFontFamily{U}{cry}{\hyphenchar\font=-1}
\DeclareFontShape{U}{cry}{m}{n}{ <-> cryst}{}
\newcommand{\cry}[1]{{\usefont{U}{cry}{m}{n} \symbol{#1}}}

To produce the graphical symbol number n in the text, use the command
\cry{n}

n is the number of the symbol in the list of symbols (see file cryst1.pdf).
For example, the command \cry{41} will produce the symbol for a 4_1 axis.

Use \put(..,..){\makebox(0,0)[Pos]{\cry{..}}}  commands to position the
symbols in \put commands in picture environments (cf. file cryst1.pdf).
