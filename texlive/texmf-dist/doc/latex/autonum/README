----------------------------------------------------------------

This is the autonum package, automatically numbering only the equations which
are referenced.
This package is similar to mathtools' showonlyrefs option, but without
introducing the bug to overwrite long equations with the equation number.

Usage: \usepackage{autonum}

Everything else should happen automatically.
To use autonum together with other packages, load autonum last.
