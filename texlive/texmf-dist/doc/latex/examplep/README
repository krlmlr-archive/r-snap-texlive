Verbatim phrases and listings in LaTeX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
README by pts@fazekas.hu at Sun Jan 16 15:33:24 CET 2005

This directory contains the examplep LaTeX package, which provides
sophisticated features for typesetting verbatim source code listings,
including the display of the source code and its compiled LaTeX or METAPOST
output side-by-side, with automatic width detection and enabled page breaks
(in the source), without the need for specifying the source twice. Special
care is taken so section, page and footnote numbers do not interfere with the
main document. For typesetting short verbatim phrases, a replacement for the
\verb command is also provided in the package, which can be used inside
tables and moving arguments such as footnotes and section titles. The
listings package is used for syntax highlighting.

The article (eurotex_2005_examplep.pdf) reviews the design decisions made
during the package development and also presents some interesting
implementation internals. examplep is compared to standard LaTeX packages
such as listings, ltxdoc, sverb and moreverb. The new codep package and its
accomanying Perl script, which provide a convenient interface to the examplep
package for authors of manuals, is also presented. With codep it is possible
to generate the source code, the LaTeX or METAPOST output and the compilable
example file onto the CD from a single source embedded into the appropriate
place of the .tex document file.
