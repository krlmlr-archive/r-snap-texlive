Notes:

  To make use of this package, you need a working version of
  Functional MetaPost. You can download this software from

  http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~ralf/software.html

  You also need a Haskell interpreter; the basic setup of the FMP
  package supports the wide-spread hugs program. More information
  on hugs can be found at

  http://www.haskell.org/hugs/

  Before you make use of this package, ensure that your FMP
  installation works okay. Note that I cannot in general give any
  support for FMP as such.

  Happy FMPing!
