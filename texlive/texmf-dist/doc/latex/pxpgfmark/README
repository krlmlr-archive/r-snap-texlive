LaTeX: to make inter-picture connections work with e-pTeX engine

PGF/TikZ's feature of “inter-picture connections” 
(`remember picture` option) depends on the “save position” feature
of pdfTeX. Today the latter feature is also supported by XeTeX
and e-(u)pTeX engines. Unfortunately, PGF's driver for dvipdfmx
relies on testing on engine (not feature) and thus inter-picture
connections still fail on e-pTeX + dvipdfmx. This package fixes
the problem.

### Installation

  - `*.sty` → $TEXMF/tex/latex/PXpgfmark

### Usage

Load this package after tikz (or pgf) package.

    \documentclass[dvipdfmx]{article}
    \usepackage{tikz} % or pgf
    \usepackage{pxpgfmark}

Note that this package is of no use unless you work on e-(u)pTeX +
dvipdfmx combination.
