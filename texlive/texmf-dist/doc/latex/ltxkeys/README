SUMMARY

The ltxkeys package provides facilities for creating and managing
keys in the sense of the keyval and xkeyval packages, but it
is intended to be more robust and faster. Its robustness emanates
from its ability to preserve braces in key values throughout
parsing. The need to preserve braces in key values emerges often
in parsing keys. This is often the case in, eg, the xwatermark
package. Depending on the functions called by the user, this
package is faster than the xkeyval package because, among other
features, it avoids character-wise parsing of key values (which
is called selective sanitization by the xkeyval package).

It also provides many new functions for defining and managing keys.
