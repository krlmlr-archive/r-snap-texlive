The commands used for document outlining in {\LaTeX} are quite rigid. If you define a heading to be at chapter level, it will remain at that level even when you move it to a different part of your document. While this is desirable most of the time, there are some cases in which a more flexible approach may be needed, like in collaborative work, when writing comprehensive documents or when assembling a document from many different sources. This package aims at providing means of such flexible outlining. 

Instead of specifying exactly at what level your outline element should appear, this package provides relative commands for going up and down in the outline hierarchy. The commands provided are:

\levelup{<title>} This command goes up one level in the document hierarchy, so depending on where you are, this will insert an outline element <title> at one level above the current. 

\leveldown{<title>} This command goes down one level in the document hierarchy, so depending on where you are, this will insert an outline element <title> at one level below the current. 

\levelstay{<title>} This command stays at the current document hierarchy level, so depending on where you are, this will insert an outline element <title> at the same as the current level.

\levelmultiup{<title>}{<levels>} This goes up multiple levels in the document hierarchy, so depending on where you are, this will insert an outline element <title> at a level differing by <levels> from the current level. This may be used for situation in which level skipping is required. While downwards you will go only one level, upwards a skip of more than one may be required, for instance if you are in the last subsubsection of a passage of your text and as you want to start a new passage you need to insert a section.
