SHORT DESCRIPTION
=================

(This is a copy of the LaTeX code of the documentation's abstract.)

This package provides a macro (|\includecombinedgraphics|) for the
inclusion of combined EPS/\LaTeX{} and PDF/\LaTeX{} graphics (an export
format of Gnuplot, Xfig, and maybe other programs).  Instead of including
the graphics with a simple |\input|, the |\includecombinedgraphics| macro
has some benefits:

\begin{itemize}
  \item changing the font and color of the text of the \LaTeX{} parts
  \item rescaling the graphics without affecting the font of the \LaTeX{}
    parts
  \item automatic inclusion of the vector graphics parts, as far as \LaTeX{}
    parts do not do it (e.\,g., for files exported from Gnuplot before
    version 4.2 or Xfig)
  \item changing the inclusion order of \LaTeX{} and vector graphics
    parts (e.\,g., Gnuplot 4.4 exports files in a way that the vector
    graphics part overlays the \LaTeX{} part, which means that text may be
    hidden under shaded areas)
  \item rescaling and rotating of complete graphics (similar to
    |\includegraphics| from \textsf{graphicx} package)
  \item scaling the vector graphics part (without affecting the font) to
    a defined width or height of the graphics, which might, e.g., be of
    importance for graphics that are intended for publication in a journal
    requesting a certain size of graphics
\end{itemize}

A test PDF file with extensively commented examples is shipped with this
package and a BASH script (\texttt{texpic2epspdf.sh}) to convert combined
EPS/\LaTeX{} and PDF/\LaTeX{} graphics to EPS or PDF files with text part
included.

See `combinedgraphics.pdf' for detailed information on usage.

BUILDING
========

If you do not want to use any pre-build `combinedgraphics.sty' and
`combinedgraphics.pdf' files, you will have to choose one of the following
two ways for building them. Otherwise you can skip this section.

1) Building with make
---------------------

Running `make' will create the LaTeX package, the documentation and the test
file:
  $ make

2) Building manually
--------------------

a) Generation of package (.sty file):

Run `combinedgraphics.ins' through LaTeX:
  $ pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode combinedgraphics.ins

b) Generation of documentation:

Run `combinedgraphics.dtx' through LaTeX:
  $ pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode combinedgraphics.dtx

Then create the index and change history:
  $ makeindex -s gind.ist -o combinedgraphics.ind combinedgraphics.idx
  $ makeindex -s gglo.ist -o combinedgraphics.gls combinedgraphics.glo

Finally, run `combinedgraphics.dtx' three time through LaTeX:
  $ pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode combinedgraphics.dtx
  $ pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode combinedgraphics.dtx
  $ pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode combinedgraphics.dtx

Optionally you can compile the test file:
  $ pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode combinedgraphics_test.tex
  $ pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode combinedgraphics_text.tex
  $ pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode combinedgraphics_text.tex

INSTALLATION
============

1) Installing with make
-----------------------

To install the package into a TDS (= TeX directory structure; typically its base
directory is named `texmf' or something similar), run the following command:
  $ make DESTDIR=<your TDS> install

Note: `$(DESTDIR)' defaults to `$(HOME)/.texmf'.

2) Installing manually
----------------------

In principle, you will only habe to copy the file `ionumbers.sty' into a
directory, where LaTeX can find it.  If you copy it into a TDS (TeX directory
structure), you will most probably have to run the following command afterwards:
  $ mktexlsr <your TDS>
