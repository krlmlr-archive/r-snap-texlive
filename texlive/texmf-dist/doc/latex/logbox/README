Package: logbox - e-TeX showbox facilities (FC)
-------------------------------------------------------------
logbox provides facilities to display the contents of boxes in
the log file or print them with their dimensions in the final
document.

For "exploration purpose".

The TeX primitive \showbox stops the compilation.
Looking at the box contents requires to set the \showboxbreadth
and \showboxdepth parameters accordingly.

logbox.sty sets those parameters, the \interactionmode is temporarily
set so that the compilation don't stop and the box description can
finally be explored in the .log file.

As a tracing command, \logbox also works in harmony with the tracing
parameter: \tracingoutput.


Commands provided:

\logbox          : TeX \showbox without stop in the compilation
                                + \showboxbreadth >=  10
