           README for the `longnamefilelist' package
                    (C) Uwe Lueck 2012/03/13


`longnamefilelist.sty' equips LaTeX's \listfiles with an optional 
argument for the number of characters in the longest base filename. 
This way you get a neatly aligned file list even when it contains 
files whose base names have more than 8 characters. The package can 
be combined with `myfilist.sty' as explained in the documentation.

KEYWORDs: file info list; package management, document management, 
          macro programming, plain text output, alignment
