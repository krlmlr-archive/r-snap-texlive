INSTALLATION
------------

- To generate "jvlisting.sty" and to create an additional file
  "examples.tex" containing a few examples, you can run the following
  command:

    tex jvlisting.ins

  After this step, you can try the examples by running the newly
  created file "examples.tex" through LaTeX:

    latex examples.tex

- For simple installation, just move "jvlisting.sty" in a directory
  where LaTeX can find it.  The jvlisting manual is in the file
  "jvlisting.pdf".

- The regenerate the manual:

    latex jvlisting.dtx

- A list of test cases which I use for debugging can be found in the
  file "test.tex".
