    The step packages are for typesetting ISO 10303 International Standard 
documents. The iso class is required for the use of these packages.
Configuration files for TeX4ht are also provided.

    The distribution is under the LPPL and consists of the following files:
README (this file)
stepe.dtx
stepe.ins
stepe.pdf
step4ht.dtx
step4ht.ins
step4ht.pdf
stepman.tex
stepman.pdf

Changes in the 2002 release:
o Updated to reflect the current ISO/IEC Directives (the Fourth edition)
  and the current (July 2002) Supplementary Directives.

  To install the packages
o run: latex stepe.ins (which will generate *.sty and *.tex files)
o Move the generated files to a location where LaTeX will find them
  (if you don't know where that is, see the FAQ on CTAN in /help/uktug-FAQ).

o Optionally, to regenerate the commented source code
  o run: latex stepe.dtx
  o run: makeindex -s gind.ist stepe
  o run: latex stepe.dtx
  o print stepe.dvi for a hardcopy

o For the User Manual, either latex stepman.tex or print stepman.pdf 

o If you might use TeX4ht (which might well not work):
  o run: latex step4ht.dtx (which will generate *.4ht file(s))
  o To print the commented source code, follow instructions above on step4ht.dtx
  o Move the generated *.4ht file(s) to a location where TeX4ht will find them

    Don't forget to update the (La)TeX file database if you have one.
