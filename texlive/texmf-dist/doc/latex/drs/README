The package drs.sty draws Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs). It can draw 
embedded DRSs, if-then conditions and quantificational “duplex conditions” (with 
a properly scaled connecting diamond). Formatting parameters allow the user to 
control the appearance and placement of DRSs, and of DRS variables and conditions.
