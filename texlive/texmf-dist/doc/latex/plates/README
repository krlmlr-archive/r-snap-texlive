* Description
=============

The plates package provides a simple facility for inserting color
figures in documents they should be gathered and printed together
--- just like in books with a section of color plates. The benefit of
such a facility is to allow these special figures to be printed
separately  and later slipped into the final document. The package
provides the plates environment to handle this situation. The user
need only place these special figures in a plate environment
instead of a figure environment and issue a command to print the
plates at a chosen location in the document. Additional, if the
author wishes to have a version of the document where the color
figures are included in the text merely including the
figures option will change the behavior of the plates
environment to a figure environment, causing the plates to be
printed directly in the text.
