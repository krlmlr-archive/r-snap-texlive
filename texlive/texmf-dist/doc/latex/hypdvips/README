LaTeX package hypdvips 2014/06/22 v3.02

The hypdvips package is a collection of add-ons and fixes for problems when
using hyperref with dvips. It adds support for breaking links, hyperlinked
tablenotes, file attachments, embedded documents and different types of GoTo-
links. In addition, the cooperation with cleveref allows an enhanced back-
referencing system.
