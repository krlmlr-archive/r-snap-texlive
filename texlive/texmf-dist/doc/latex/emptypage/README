emptypage -- Suppress page numbers and headings on empty pages

Karl Wette, 2010/05/30

This package suppresses page numbers and headings from appearing
on empty pages. The code for doing this is not mine and already
exists in various places; all I've done is create a convenient
stand-alone package for it. See the documentation for usage.

History:
* v1.2 (2010/05/30} Fixed whitespace bug
* v1.1 (2009/07/09) Fancy docstrip version
* v1.0 (2008/12/20) Plain old .sty version
