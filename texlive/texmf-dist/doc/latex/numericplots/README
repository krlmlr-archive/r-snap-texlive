Plotting numeric data is a task which often has to be done for scientific
papers. In \LaTeX, however, it is only possible to include graphics created with
an external program. The pstricks-packages provide very many commands to
generate graphics in \LaTeX. To generate simple graphics from numeric data,
however, it is difficult to use. This package provides a simpler interface for
the pstricks-package to plot numeric data.
