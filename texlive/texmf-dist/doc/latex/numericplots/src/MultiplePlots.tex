\section{Multiple plots in one picture}\label{sec:MultiplePlots}

xPicMin, xPicMax, yPicMin and yPicMax are the inner coordinates of one picture.
The position of the axes are defined in this coordinate system via xCoordMin,
xCoordMax, yCoordMin and yCoordMax.

Example:


\lstinputlisting[firstline=8]{examples/multiplots_exampleI}

\input{examples/multiplots_exampleI}


An example with different y-axes on the left and on the right side:

\lstinputlisting{examples/multiplots_exampleII}

\input{examples/multiplots_exampleII}


It is also possible to rotate the labels of the axes (LabelRot and LabelRefPt
have to be set after AxisStyle!):

\lstinputlisting[firstline=12, lastline=20]{examples/multiplots_exampleIII}

\input{examples/multiplots_exampleIII}
