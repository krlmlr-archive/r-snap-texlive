This is the README file for the decorule package.

Summary

This package implements a decorative swelled rule using
only a symbol from a font installed with all distributions of
\TeX{}, so it works independently, without the need to install
any additional software or fonts.

This is the packaged version of the macro which was
originally published in the 'Typographers' Inn'
column in TUGboat (Flynn 2010).

This version fixes the bug caused by failing to supply the
correct values for DVI drivers for rendering glyph rotation.
The result now works in Postscript output but DVI viewers may
still display incorrectly.

INSTALLATION

To install this package, run LaTeX on the decorule.ins file.
This will create the package file decorule.sty, which you must 
move to a directory (folder) where LaTeX will find it. 

For personal installations, that is:

(Mac)              ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/decorule
(Unix / GNU/Linux) ~/texmf/tex/latex/decorule
(MS-Windows 95/XP) C:\texmf\tex\latex\decorule
(Windows 7/8)      Computer\System\Users\your~name\texmf\tex\latex\decorule
                      [replacing your-name with your account name]

Create that directory (folder) if it does not exist.

If you are a Windows user with MiKTeX and this is your 
first time installing packages by hand, you must also 
add the texmf folder to MiKTeX's list of supported
folders (in the Roots tab of the MiKTeX Maintenance/Settings
program), and then update the FNDB in the General tab.

For shared installations (multi-user systems), identify 
the shared local directory with the command

   kpsewhich -expand-var '$TEXMFLOCAL'

This will give you the texmf location within which you must
create the tex/latex/decorule subdirectories. Do not forget
to run the texhash or mktexlsr filename indexer program
after installation, otherwise the files will not be findable.
