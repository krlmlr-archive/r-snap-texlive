This is the file README for the CodeDoc class, v.0.3.
You'll find complete documentation in CodeDoc-manual.pdf

This class produces code and documentation in a single file without departing from LaTeX's ordinary
syntax.


TO PRODUCE THE DOCUMENTATION:
Run LaTeX on CodeDoc-manual.tex (better in PDF).
In the document class options of the latter file,
you may uncomment the `obeystop' option and/or
comment out the `index' option to remove the
implementation from the documentation and/or
the index.
Don't forget to run LaTeX and MakeIndex as many
times as necessary.

TO PRODUCE THE CLASS ITSELF (codedoc.cls):
Uncomment the `produce' option among the
class options and run LaTeX on the same file
(CodeDoc-manual.tex).
This serves as an illustration only, since
to do so you already need codedoc.cls, obviously.
This file should thus be included in any distribution.
