You are allowed to distribute this file under the condition that it is
distributed together with all the following files:
   rcsinfo.sty      LaTeX package
   rcsinfo.pdf      Documentation
   rcsinfo.ins      Create script for all other files
   rcsinfo.dtx      Source of all
   rcsinfo.perl     use with latex2html
   rcsinfo.init     use with latex2html
   Makefile
   README

If you receive only some of these files from someone, complain!

To install:
  unpack and
  `make'
or execute the commands manualy:
  latex rcsinfo.ins     // creates the file of this package
  latex rcsinfo.dtx     // create the package documentation

and if latex2html is installed on your system:
  latex2html -dir html -init_file rcsinfo.init \
	     -html_version 4.0,math rcsinfo2html.tex

The following files are created by 'latex rcsinfo.ins'
	- rcsinfo.cfg
	- rcsinfo.sty
	- rcsinfo.perl
	- rcsinfo.init
	- rcsinfo2html.tex

then copy the files
  rcsinfo.sty
  rcsinfo.cfg
to a place where LaTeX can find it
  (e.g. under UNIX: $HOME/tex/inputs
   and set the environment variable
	TEXINPUTS=$HOME/tex/inputs//:$TEXINPUTS
  )
and
  rcsinfo.perl
to a place where latex2html will find it.

HISTORY
1.11    : Added option datehyphen (file date may look like YYYY-MM-DD instead
          of YYYY/MM/DD)
1.10    : Added option scrpage2
1.9     : The initial $ of $Id may be omitted.
1.8     : rcsinfo.perl can deal now with latex2html version 99.1.
	  Restructured package files.
1.7.1   : Make does not abort, if laext2html is not found
1.7     : Underscores in file names are now handeled correctly.
1.6     : Fixed problems with the french-option of `babel'.
	  (The `:' is made active when using the french language.
	   Now rcsinfo can handle this situation).
1.5     : - The Babel-package is not loaded automagically anymore.
	    This avoids problems within the `babel'-package when other
	    packages (like `ifthen' or `varioref') are loaded _and_ no
	    language was given in the `documentclass'.
	  - Fixed the `notoday' option.
1.4     : Support fancyhdr-package, added rcsinfo.cfg configuration file.
1.3	: Fixed documentation, new address, reimplemeted parts, added
	  rcsinfo.perl.
1.2	: New Makefile.
1.1	: (internal changes).
