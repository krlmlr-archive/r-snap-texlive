Version: 1.03, 2014/05/01

Changes in version 1.03
Corrected a number of issues in scanpages.sty and its documentation so that the package now works as documented.

Changes in version 1.02
Corrected documentation and modified the scripts to handle text documents using carriage return for end-of-line.

Changes in version 1.01
AppleScript modified to remove dependence on external library TSLib. It is now self-contained.

The sty file package contains macros to assist in embellishing a scanned document from the pre-TeX era, correcting positioning, adding footnotes, hyperlinks, indexing and so on. The script files provide ways to reduce the labor in preparing a .tex file with the required flexibility. For details, consult scanpages-doc.pdf.
