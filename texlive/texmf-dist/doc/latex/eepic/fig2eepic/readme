fig2epic V1.0a supports Fig-TFX codes in changing font type and font
sizes. It also supports black filled for cirlce and ellipse. You
need to have the Transfig package in order to compile fig2epic.
Transfig can be obtained from svax.cs.cornell.edu

EPIC can be obtained from cs.rochester.edu in
public/latex-style/eepic.shar[12] and EEPIC can be obained from
iris.ucdavis.edu[128.120.57.20] in pub/EEPIC10.shar using
anonymous ftp. 

When the configuration file option is included in the
compilation, the new ANSI keyword "void" is used. If your
compiler does not support the "void" type, you will get 30+
warning about "illegal pointer combination" or similar messages.
However, the program should still work.

fig2epic has been tested on BSD 4.3, SUN OS 3.4, Ultrix 2.1 and
Encore Umax 4.2

Bugs report, suggestions and comments are always welcome.
