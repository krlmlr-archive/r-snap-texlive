.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fig2epic
translates fig objects in the named
.I fig-file
into EPIC or EEPIC macros and puts them in
.I tex-file.
If a file name is presented, it is assumed to be the input file (fig
output file). The output file
.I (tex-file),
if not presented, will be the stdout.
If the
.I fig-file
is not presented, input will be assumed to come from the stdin.
The output from fig2epic can be edited to change font sizes/types.
.LP
Fig (Facility for Interactive Generation of figures) is a screen-oriented
tool which allows the user to draw and manipulate objects interactively.
It runs under the Suntools/Sunview window environment.
Fig2epic is compatible with Fig versions 1.3 and 1.4.
.LP
EPIC is an enhancement to LaTeX picture drawing environment.
It was developed by Sunil Podar of Department of Computer Science
in S.U.N.Y at Stony Brook.
.LP
EEPIC is an extension to EPIC and LaTeX picture drawing
environment. It was written by Conrad Kwok of Division of
Computer Science at University of California, Davis.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-S
Set the scale at which the figure is rendered to. This option
automatically set the magnification and default font to
.I scale
/ 12 and 
.I scale
-tt respectively. The font can be changed using \-F option.
The default is 12 and other valid options are 8, 9, 10 and 11.
.TP
.B \-s
Change the default font size to
.I size
.TP
.B \-m
Set the magnification at which the figure is rendered to
.I mag.
The default is 1.0 unless \-s option is used.
.TP
.B \-c
Use 
.I cfg-file
as the configuration file.
.TP
.B \-F
Set the font specification command which precedes every text object in the
picture to
.I fspec.
This option, if specified, overrides any font changing commands.
The default is none.
Note that no "\\" is required in the font name.
.TP
.B \-l
Use "\fB\\thicklines\fR" when width of the line is wider than 
.I lwidth.
The default is 2.
.TP
.B \-L
Use the specified language 
.I lang
in the output. Default is EEPIC. Other valid options are EPIC and
EEPIC-EMU. EEPIC-EMU is for use with EEPIC emulation package.
.TP
.B \-v
Include comment in the output file.

.SH LATEX MACROS
In order to include EPIC or EEPIC pictures into a document, it is
necssary to load the EPIC and EEPIC macros. It can be done by
including \fBEPIC\fR and \fBEEPIC\fR in \fB\\documentstyle\fR
option. See the EPIC or EEPIC manaul for details.

.SH Configuration File
All the defaults in fig2epic can be changed using configuration
file. When fig2pic is executed, it will look for the files
specified in \-c option if any, 
.I fig-file.cfg
(if
.I fig-file
is ended with ".fig", it will be replaced by ".cfg"), fig2epic.cfg
and $HOME/.fig2epic in the order specified above. The first
configuration file found will be used.

.TP
.I LowerLeftX
This specify X coordinate of the lower left hand corner of the Fig
picture. Default is 0.
.TP
.I LowerLeftY
This specify Y coordinate of the lower left hand corner in unitlength of the Fig
picture. Default is 0.
.TP
.I TopMargin
Set the distance in unitlength of the figure from the top of the
LaTeX picture box. Default is 5.
.TP
.I BottomMargin
Set the distance in unitlength of the figure from the bottom of the
LaTeX picture box. Default is 10.
.TP
.I SegmentLength
The maximum segment length in inch used in generating splines
(for EPIC) and arc (for EPIC and EEPIC-EMU). Default is 0.0625
inch.
.TP
.I TextFont
Set the font used for all text. This option overrides FontType
and FontSize. However, it is overrided by \-s, -S and -F options.
Note that no "\\" is required in the font name.
.TP
.I Magnification
Same as \-m option. Default is 1.0.
.TP
.I Verbose
Same as \-v. Default is FALSE
.TP
.I DotDistance
Dot distance in unitlength for dotted lines.
.TP
.I LineThick
Same as \-l. Default is 2.
.TP
.I Language
Same is -L. Default is EEPIC
.TP
.I DashScale
Scale the dash length. Default is 1.0.
.TP
.I EllipseCommand
Specify the command used in drawing an ellipse. Default is
ellipse for EEPIC or EEPIC-EMU. oval is always used for EPIC. Possible 
values are ellipse and oval.
.TP
.I UseBox
Specify whether fig2epic should generate \\framebox and/or
\\dashbox command
in the output file or not. Default is not to use the *box
command. Possible options are none, solid, dash and both.
.TP
.I DashType
This option is only used when EPIC option is selected. Valid options
are "Normal" (use dashline in drawing dash lines), "Economic"
(use drawline with -50 stretch in drawing dash lines) and
"Dotted" (use dotted lines to replace dash lines). Default is
"Normal". "Normal" option will use up TeX memory quickly if long
dash lines are drawn. If you get "TeX Capacity Exceed" error, you should
try the "Economic" or "Dotted" option.
.TP
.I FontType
Selects one of the following font types as the default--Roman,
Bold, Italics, Modern and Typewriter. Default is Typewriter.
.TP
.I FontSize
Selects default font size in points. Default is 12.
