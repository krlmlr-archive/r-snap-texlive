1 INTRODUCTION
==============

This package allows to automatically hyperlink uris of type arXiv, ASIN,
DOI, HDL, NBN, PubMed, OID, TINY, TINY with preview, and XMPP in
such a way that they are resolved to an address understood by web browsers
without native support or add-ons for such types of uri and provides com-
mands citeurl, mailto, ukoeln, and uref.

Trademarks appear throughout this README without any trademark symbol;
they are the property of their respective trademark owner.
There is no intention of infringement; the usage is to the benefit of
the trademark owner.

2 DOWNLOAD
==========

`uri' is available on CTAN:
  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/uri/

Also a ZIP file is provided that contains the files, already
sorted in a TDS tree:
  CTAN:install/macros/latex/contrib/uri.tds.zip

`CTAN:' means one of the `Comprehensive TeX Archive Network'
nodes or one of its mirrors. This is explained in
  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=archives

The CTAN stuff will be mirrored automatically from the
ftp server, so
  ftp://ftp.tug.org/pub/tex/pagesLTS/
corresponds to
  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/pagesLTS/


3 INSTALLATION
==============

Installation with ZIP file in TDS format
----------------------------------------
The ZIP file `uri.tds.zip' contains the files sorted
in a TDS tree. Thus you can directly unpack the ZIP file
inside a TDS tree.
(See CTAN:tds.zip for an explanation of TDS.)
Example:
  cd /...somewhere.../texmf
  unzip /...downloadpath.../uri.tds.zip
Do not forget to refresh the file name database of this
TDS tree.
Example:
  texhash /...somewhere.../texmf

Manual installation
-------------------
a) Download the uri files from CTAN or the TUG server.
   If necessary, unpack them.
b) Generate the package and driver files:
     tex uri.ins
c) Install the files `*.sty', and `*.cfg' in your TDS tree:
     cp *.sty *.cfg TDS:tex/latex/uri/
   Replace `TDS:' by the prefix of your TDS tree
   (texmf directory).
d) Copy the documentation files to
   "TDS:doc/latex/uri/":
   README, uri.pdf, uri-example.tex, uri-example.pdf.
e) Update the databases if necessary, e. g. for teTeX:
     mktexlsr .../texmf


4 ADDITIONAL PACKAGES
=====================

Depending on the driver and option settings, uri loads
other packages:
* kvoptions.sty:
    CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/kvoptions.pdf
* url.sty:
    CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/url/url.dtx
which again load other packages
(see the result of the \listfiles comman in the log-file
 of the example).


5 PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY
=======================

uri should be loaded
AFTER package hyperref,if hyperlinks are wanted,
and BEFORE package hyperref, if hyperlinks are not wanted.

7 BUG REPORTS
==============

A bug report should contain:
* Comprehensive problem description. This includes error or
  warning messages.
  * \errorcontextlines=\maxdimen can be added in the
    TeX code to get more informations in TeX error messages.
* Minimal test file that shows the problem, but does not
  contain any unnecessary packages and code.
* Used drivers/programs.
* Version information about used packages and programs.
  * If you are using LaTeX, then add "\listfiles". Then
    a list of version informations is printed at the end
    of the LaTeX run.
* Please no other files than the minimal test file.
  The other files .log, .dvi, .ps, .pdf are seldom
  necessary, so send them only on request.
* Please .zip or .tar.gz your file(s) before sending them!
