Remark:
=======

These instructions were take from the KOMA-Script distribution. If you
find instructions there stating "KOMA-Script" exchange that with
"pdfcprot" -- I just forgot to adjust it. ;-)

Installation
============

Preamble:
---------

This manual is only for use with TeX installations using TDS. Examples
of those TeX installations are teTeX and MikTeX. If you are not sure,
search about a directory named `texmf'. Perhaps there are more lots of
directories named `texmf'. At unix you may find `/usr/texmf' (or
`/usr/share/texmf'), `/usr/local/texmf' (or `/usr/local/share/texmf')
and several users with `~/texmf' (`texmf' at the home directory of
several users). At windows with MikTeX this is often `\texmf' or 
`\Miktex' and `\localtexmf'.

One of these is the primary texmf tree of the package manager
(`/usr/texmf' or `/usr/share/texmf', with MikTeX `\texmf' or 
`\Miktex'). This was created at the installation of your TeX 
distribution.

One of these is the system texmf tree (`/usr/local/texmf' or
`/usr/local/share/texmf', with MikTeX `\localtexmf'). If you are
administrator use this texmf tree to install pdfcprot.

If you install pdfcprot as normal user, you have to ask your
administrator, where to install pdfcprot. You can also ask
texmf.cfg, if you can use a local texmf tree at your HOME directory.

Short:

- Do NOT install pdfcprot at the primary texmf tree of the package
  manager (e.g. if you're using MikTeX not at `\texmf' oder `\Miktex').
- If you are administrator, install pdfcprot at the system texmf
  tree.
- If you are normal user, use the texmf tree of your HOME directory or
  "Own Files" at windows or ask your administrator.

In the following `.../texmf' is used for your texmf tree. If you are
using windows and the explorer or DOS-prompt, you have also replace
every slash (`/') by backslash (`\'). At TeX itself you're using still
slash for directory separation.


Installation:
-------------

At Unix you may edit a `Makefile' called copy of `Makefile.unx', set
variable TEXMF to your texmf tree, save Makefile and call make. If no
error occurs, you can do the installation with `make install'
subsequently.

If you don't use Unix or don't like Makefile, do this:

1. Copy all files of pdfcprot bundle to a new directory and change
   to this directory.
2. Call LaTeX with filename pdfcprot.ins. At Unix just say:
       latex pdfcprot.ins
   This may be done at windows, too.
   If LaTeX tells you some files already existing, DO NOT overwrite
   them, yet.
   Inform yourself, which files are newer, the one you want to install
   or the already installed. Afterwards call LaTeX again an overwrite
   older files - and only older - by newer.
3. Copy all generated files ending `.sty' and all files ending `.cpa'
   into the directory `.../texmf/tex/latex/pdfcprot'. If there
   isn't a directory named `.../texmf/tex/latex/pdfcprot', create
   it. (Remember! This is `\localtexmf\tex\latex\pdfcprot' at 
   MikTeX.)
4. Maybe you have to inform your TeX distribution about the newly
   installed files. Using teTeX you have to call `texhash', using 
   MikTeX this is `Refresh Filename Database'. At fpTeX there is also
   an entry at windows start button. Ask the manual of your
   distribution or your administrator.  
5. Read the documentation of pdfcprot. If you don't know l2short and
   usrguide, read them also before reading it.

Have a nice day, even if you don't understand my 
`something-like-english'!
