____________________
The MATHALFA package

This package provides a standard means of setting math alphabets 
associated with the macros \mathcal, \mathbb, \mathfrak and \mathscr
and, where available, their bold counterparts \mathbcal, \mathbbb, 
\mathbfrak and \mathbscr. 
It mostly bypasses the usual fd and sty files used to load these 
alphabets in order to allow each to be scaled independently and 
without silently quantizing the sizes.

This version (1.07) corrects an issue with previously loaded \mathfrak.
