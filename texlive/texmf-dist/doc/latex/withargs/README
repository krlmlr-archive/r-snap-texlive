===== Prerequisites =====

To use this package, you need the following expl3 packages:
* expl3
* l3regex
* xparse

To generate the documentation some extra packages are needed.

===== Installation =====

withargs.sty is provided directly in the package archive. Put
it in a place where your LaTeX distribution can find it.

(withargs.sty is not generated, but manually maintained; you
 may use docstrip to remove the documentation, but you don't
 have to; it will just work the way it is)

===== Documentation =====

withargs.pdf is provided directly in the package archive. To
generate the documentation yourself, run LaTeX on withargs.tex.

(withargs.tex does not contain the package code itself; it inputs
 withargs.sty directly to document the implementation)
