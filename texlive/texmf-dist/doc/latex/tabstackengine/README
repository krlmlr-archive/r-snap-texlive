The tabstackengine Package


The tabstackengine package provides a front end to the stackengine
package, to allow tabbed stacking.  In most cases, an existing
stackengine command may be prepended with the word "tabbed", "align" or
"tabular" to create a new tabbed version of a stacking macro.

Additionally, hooks are provided into the package's parser, so that
(completely outside of any stacking constructions) tabbed strings of
data may be parsed, extracted, and reconstituted.
