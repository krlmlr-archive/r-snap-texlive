Sparklines are intense, simple, wordlike graphics (so named by Edward
Tufte). In lieu of a more detailed introduction, Professor Tufte's site
has an early release of a chapter on sparklines, see
www.edwardtufte.com. A PHP implementation can be found at
http://sparkline.sourceforge.net/.

A sparkline can be added using the sparkline environment. Also, you can
add sparkling rectangles for the median and special sparkling dots in
red or blue. Only use sparklines with pdflatex, or with PostScript
output; sparklines cannot appear in a dvi-file. The sparklines package
uses pgf, and does not work with pictex. It but might work if
pictexwd.sty is used, but that has not been tested.

Read sparklines.pdf for more details including history.
