			  Package issuulinks

				 v1.1

PDF visualizer ISSUU (http://issuu.com) is a popular service
allowing to show PDF documents ``one page a time''.  Due to the way
it is implemented, internal links in these documents are not
allowed.  Instead, they must be converted to external ones in the
form http://issuu.com/action/page?page=PAGENUMBER.  

This package patches hyperref to produce external links in the
required form instead of internal links created by \ref, \cite and
other commands.

Since the package redefines the internals of hyperref, you need to
call it AFTER hyperref.

The author is grateful to FAO UN which partially funded this work
and to Matthieu Stigler, Adam Prakash \& Filippo Gheri for
suggesting and testing this package.

Changes in v1.1:
	Added standard warnings about undedined/changed references
