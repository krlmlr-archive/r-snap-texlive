Guidelines for contributed languages
------------------------------------

Now language files are "outsourced" and are located in a separate
directory, so that they are contributed directly to CTAN (please, do
not send to me language styles just to upload them to CTAN):

/macros/latex/contrib/babel-contrib

Of course, placing your style files in this directory is not mandatory,
but if you want to do it, here are a few guidelines.

- Do not hesitate stating on the file heads you are the author and the
  maintainer, if you actually are. There is no need to state the babel
  maintainer(s) as authors if they have not contributed significantly
  to your language files. 
- Fonts are not strictly part of a language, so they are best placed
  in the corresponding TeX tree. This includes not only tfm, vf, ps1,
  otf, mf files and the like, but also fd ones.
- Font and input encodings are usually best placed in the
  corresponding tree, too, but sometimes they belong more naturally to
  the babel style.  Note you may also need to define a LICR.
- Babel ldf files may just interface a framework, as it happens often
  with Oriental language/scripts. This framework is best placed in its
  own directory.
- And do not forget providing a manual (as a stand-alone document).

If your need further assistance and technical advice in the
development of language styles, I am willing to help you.  And of
course, you can make any suggestion you like.
