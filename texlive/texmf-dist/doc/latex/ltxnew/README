% ltxnew provides the  \new, \renew and  \provide prefixes for checking
% definitions. It is designed to work with e-TeX distributions of LaTeX
% and relies on the LaTeX macro \@ifdefinable.
%
% Local  allocation  of counters,  dimensions,  skips,  muskips,  boxes,
% tokens  and marks  are provided by the  etex.sty package.
%
% \new  and  \renew  as well  as  \provide  may be used  for all kind of
% control sequences. Please refer to the section "Using \new" of the pdf
% documentation.
