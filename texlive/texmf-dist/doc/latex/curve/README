* Description
=============

CurVe is a Curriculum Vitae class package for LaTeX2e. It provides you with a
set of commands to create rubrics, entries in these rubrics etc. CurVe will
then properly format your CV for you (possibly splitting it onto multiple
pages, repeating the titles etc), which is usually the most painful part of CV
writing. Another nice feature of CurVe is its ability to manage different CV
"flavors" simultaneously. It is in fact often the case that you want to
maintain slightly divergent versions of your CV at the same time, in order to
emphasize on different aspects of your background. CurVe also comes with
support for AUC-TeX.

* Installation
==============

If you are building CurVe from the tarball you need to execute the following
steps in order to extract the necessary files:

[pdf]latex curve.ins -> will create the class file curve.cls
[pdf]latex curve.dtx -> (twice) will create the documentation files curve.pdf
                        or curve.dvi. Note that curve.pdf is already part of
                        the distribution.

After that, you need to install the generated documentation and class file to
a location where LaTeX can find them. For a TDS-compliant layout, the
following locations are suggested:

[TEXMF]/tex/latex/curve/curve.cls
[TEXMF]/doc/latex/curve/curve.[pdf|dvi]

If you're an AUC-TeX user, you may also install the file `curve.el' in a
suitable AUC-TeX style directory.

Once you have installed the package, you might eventually want to process the
example files from the examples/ directory. Just type "make pdf" or "make dvi"
in that directory to compile everything.


	Have fun!
