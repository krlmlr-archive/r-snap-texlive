2. Introduction

The gmutils.sty package provides some macros that are analogous to
the standard LaTeX ones but extend their functionality, such as
\@ifnextcat, \addtomacro or \begin(*). The others are just
conveniences I like to use in all my TeX works, such as \afterfi, \pk
or \cs.

I wouldn't say they are only for the package writers but I assume
some nonzero (La)TeX-awareness of the user.


3. Installation

Unpack the gmutils-tds.zip archive in some texmf directory or put the
gmutils.sty somewhere in the texmf/tex/latex branch on your
own. (Creating a /texmf/tex/latex/gm directory may be advisable if you
consider using other packages written by me.)

Then you should refresh your TeX distribution's files'
database most probably.


4. Contents

The distribution of this package consists of the following three files and a TDS-compliant archive.

gmutils.sty
README
gmutils.pdf
gmutils-tds.zip

5. Documentation

The last of the above files (the .pdf) is a documentation compiled
from the .sty file by running LaTeX on the gmutils.sty file twice:
xelatex gmutils.sty
 in the directory you wish the documentation to be in, 
you don't have copy the .sty file  there---TeX will find it,
then MakeIndex on the gmutils.idx file, and then LaTeX
on gmutilsDoc.tex once more.

MakeIndex shell command:
         makeindex -r gmutilsDoc
The -r switch is to forbid MakeIndex make implicit ranges since the
(code line) numbers will be hyperlinks

Compiling of the documentation requires the packages: gmdoc
(gmdoc.sty and gmdocc.cls), gmverb.sty, gmutils.sty and also some
standard packages: hyperref.sty, xcolor.sty, geometry.sty,
multicol.sty, lmodern.sty, fontenc.sty that should be installed
on your computer by default.

If you have not installed the mwart.cls class (available on CTAN in
mwcls package), the result of your compilation may differ a bit from
the .pdf provided in this .zip archive in formattings: If you have not
installed mwart.cls, the standard article.cls will be used.
