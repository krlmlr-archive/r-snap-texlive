Readme file for the `scale' package v1.1.2 <99/08/13>
-----------------------------------------------------

This is the file `README', which accompanies the `scale' package
distribution.  The package scales a document by \sqrt{2} or by
\magstep2.

This is useful if you are preparing a document on e.g. A5 paper and
want to print on A4 paper to achieve a better resolution.

The `scale' package consists of three files:
    README       -  this file
    scale.dtx    -  the macro code and instructions on how to use
                     the package in `docstrip'-able format.
    scale.ins    -  The installation driver

To install the `scale' package, just run LaTeX on the file `scale.ins'.

You may redistributre this package under the terms of the GNU general
public license. Please see the file COPYING for more information.
