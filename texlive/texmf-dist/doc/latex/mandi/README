The mandi package  provides commands  for typesetting symbols, expressions, and
quantities used in introductory physics and astronomy. Many of the commands are
inspired by  Matter & Interactions  by Ruth Chabay  and Bruce Sherwood. Many of
the astronomical commands were inspired by my own classroom needs. This package
does not do computations. It only provides commands for typesetting.

Run  the  file  mandi.dtx  through (pdf)LaTeX to generate mandi.ins, mandi.sty,
vdemo.py, and mandi.pdf (user documentation). I assume a TeX Live 2011 or later
distribution is installed.
