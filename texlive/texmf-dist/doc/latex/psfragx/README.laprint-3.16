Laprint is written by Arno Linnemann. 

At time of writing, the last version of laprint can be found at
http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb16/rat/matlab/laprint/

I would like to tank Arno for taking into account some suggestions 
that allow a more robust parsing of the TeX output file.

The files laprpfx.mat contains preferences that ensure compatibility between the psfragx and laprint.

This version of laprint should be compatible with the version of 
psfragx contained in this package.
