The C.D.P. Bundle was originally developed for a free association
named "C.D.P." (more on it in the documentation), to typeset its
official letters with the appropriate letterhead; but more generally,
it can be used to typeset high-quality business letters formatted
according to Italian style conventions.  It is highly configurable,
and its modular structure provides you with building blocks of
increasing level, by means of which you can compose practically every
kind of business letter you could need (including anglo-saxon ones!).
It is also possible to write letters divided into sections and
paragraphs, to include floating figures and tables, and to use the
commands "\tableofcontents", "\listoffigures", and "\listoftables" to
compile the relevant indexes.  A single input file can contain several
letters, and each letter will have its own table of contents, etc.,
independent from the other ones.
