in the case of this work.

MEANING OF THE TERM "Work"
==========================

In the case of the C.D.P. Bundle, the "Work" is the collection of the 
following 4 files:

00readme.txt    --  start by reading this file
manifest.txt    --  the file you are reading now
cdpbundl.dtx    --  main source file
cdpbundl.ins    --  installation script

If you have received the 4 files listed above, you possess an integral copy 
of the C.D.P. Bundle.



MEANING OF THE TERM "Compiled Work"
===================================

In the case of the C.D.P. Bundle, a "Compiled Work" is the collection of:

a) the following 2 files that are also part of the "Work" (see above):

00readme.txt
manifest.txt

AND
b) the following 10 files:

letteracdp.cls          --  the letteracdp LaTeX document class
articoletteracdp.cls    --  the articoletteracdp LaTeX document class
adiseal.sty             --  the adiseal LaTeX package
lettcdpadi.cls          --  the lettcdpadi LaTeX document class
cdpaddon.sty            --  the cdpaddon LaTeX package
cdpshues-example.def    --  prototype color definition file
epson-stylus-740.def    --  other example color definition files
hp-laserjet-4500.def    /
cdpshues.cfg            --  configuration file for the cdpaddon package
cdpbundl.dvi            --  documentation in DVI format

You may, at your option, substitute the file `cdpbundl.dvi' with the
following one:

cdpbundl.pdf            --  documentation in PDF format

but at least one among the files `cdpbundl.dvi' and `cdpbundl.pdf' must be 
included in a "Compiled Work" that you want to distribute.  The file 
`cdpbundl.pdf' is obtained by submitting to the program pdflatex the file 
`cdpbundl.dtx', following the same steps as those explained in 
`00readme.txt' under the title "How to generate the documentation".



ANCILLARY FILES
===============

The package of files distributed through the Comprehensive TeX Archive 
Network (CTAN) includes also the following two files:

README          --  guide to directory contents
overview.pdf    --  general information on the C.D.P. Bundle (PDF)

These two files are included only for informative purposes and are _not_ a 
required part of the C.D.P. Bundle (of course you may, if you wish, include 
them in your distribution too).



COMMENT
=======

Please remember that, in order to distribute a LPPL-compliant copy of the 
C.D.P. Bundle, it suffices to distribute only the 4 files that constitute 
the "Work".
