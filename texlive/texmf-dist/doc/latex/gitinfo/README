    This package is obsolete, and has been replaced by gitinfo2.

    It will continue to work as before, but is now unsupported. Please
use gitinfo2 for any new repositories.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------    

    The `gitinfo' package provides to allow version control metadata
to be incorporated into documents. The metadata is obtained from
the git distributed version control system. 
    For `memoir' users, the package can, optionally, tailor some
page headers and footers with certain metadata.

    gitinfo is licenced under the LPPL. For more details, 
please see the accompanying manual: gitinfo.pdf.
