This is the supertabular bundle. It defines the supertabular and
supertabular* environments. They make it possible to have a tabular
that spans multiple pages. Each page is its own tabular environment,
thus the various parts may have different widths. If that is not what
you want you should check out longtable.sty, written by David
Carlisle. It is part of the array bundle.

For a more elaborate description of supertabular and a comparison with
longtable, see The LaTeX Companion, by Goossens, Mittelbach and
Samarin, ISBN 0-201-54199-8.

The files contained in this bundle are listed in the file MANIFEST

Supertabular can be used with LaTeX2e as a package.
