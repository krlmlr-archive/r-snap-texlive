Description:

The supertabular bundle defines the environments supertabular,
supertabular*, mpsupertabular and mpsupertabular*.
They make it possible to have a tabular that spans multiple pages.
Each page is its own tabular environment, thus the various parts 
may have different widths.
The mp-variants put the tabulars that make up the supertabular in 
minipage environments to make it easy to add footnotes to the tabular
and have them printed on the same page as where the footnotemarker 
occurs.
