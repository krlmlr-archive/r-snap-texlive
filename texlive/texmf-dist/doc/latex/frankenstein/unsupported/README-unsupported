				NOTES

			       general

  Three LaTeX packages are part of the Frankenstein bundle but are
  unsupported.  They are distributed on CTAN in a subdirectory of the
  directory containing the supported Frankenstein filesets (i.e.,
  CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/supported/frankenstein/unsupported/).  In
  a TeX installation, however, supported and unsupported macros,
  sources, and documentation should be placed together, (e.g., in
  TDS:/texmf/{doc,source,tex}/latex/frankenstein).

  If you wish to use the unsupported packages, download the entire
  "frankenstein" directory from CTAN (which will include the
  "unsupported" subdirectory).  

  To use the Makefile on the unsupported filesets, you must do two
  things.  

    1. Copy all the files in the "unsupported" subdirectory into its
       parent directory ("frankenstein").

    2. Set the variable USE_UNSUP to something nonempty either by:
	 a. uncommenting the line in the file Makefile, or
	 b. setting it in your environment, or
	 c. set the variable on the Make command line, e.g., "make
	    USE_UNSUP=t all".

  Descriptions of the four unsupported packages are below.
  Further important information about the Frankenstein bundle may be
  found in the file README.

  Installation instructions are in the file INSTALL.  
  The bits and drama packages depend on the non-Frankenstein package
  "relsize.sty".  Please see INSTALL for further information.
 
  Both the README and INSTALL files are located in the parent
  directory of this file (on CTAN) or in the same directory as this
  file (in a TeX installation).


			     non-support

  The package filesets in this directory are UNSUPPORTED.  They are
  furthermore possibly INCOMPLETE and NOT fully DOCUMENTED.

  I hope one day to complete these packages, document them, and
  support them.  I will gladly listen to feedback on them, but I do
  not take the same level of responsibility for them as for the
  packages I call "supported".  In the meantime, they are made public
  under the conditions stated below so that I can refer interested
  individuals to them.

  These packages are indeed valuable in certain ways, such as
  sometimes working as advertised, but of course I offer no
  guarantees.

			 PACKAGE DESCRIPTIONS

------------------------------------------------------------------------
				 bits
			(Frankenstein's guts)

  Bits provides a programmer's interface for a new idea called a
  "bit", which is like an environment but has a title, author, and
  other attributes usually only associated with the "document"
  environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
				drama
		    production-format stage script
			(Frankenstein's heart)

  Drama defines macros for typesetting a basic production-style stage
  script.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
			       includex
		     extra ways to include files

  Includex allows you to include just the contents of one source file
  into another, ignoring the text outside the \begin{document}
  ... \end{document} in the included file.  See also the supported
  "newclude" package, which is intended to supersede includex, though
  until I ensure that it is a satisfactory replacement I will keep
  includex around.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
		       DISTRIBUTION CONDITIONS

  All Frankenstein files are copyrighted by Matthew Swift and released
  under the conditions of the GNU General Public License contained in
  the file COPYING, which should be in the parent directory or the
  same directory as this file.

  The unsupported filesets in the same directory as this file ought to
  be distributed WITH the supported ones.  They are useless without
  the supported ones.

  I am willing to specially license this code; please simply contact
  me with your proposal.

			     TERMINOLOGY

  fileset: A group of files related to a single LaTeX package, LaTeX
           class, or BibTeX bibliography style and any accompanying
           option or configuration files.  The files in a package or
           class fileset have the same root name but different
           filename extensions.  In bibstyle filesets, some root names
           differ by a "-bst" suffix.

     CTAN: Comprehensive TeX Archive Network: a system of TeX-related
           file archives available via FTP (see
           ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/CTAN.sites) and often
           reproduced on CDROMs.

      TDS: TeX Directory Structure: a recommended directory structure
           for TeX installations.  See
           ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/tds.
