REQUIREMENTS

The package requires `relsize.sty' which can be found in: 

    /pub/tex/macros/latex/contrib/other/misc


INSTALLATION

1) Run `metre.ins' through LaTeX.

2) Copy `metre.sty' into a directory along the input path of TeX.

3) Run `metre.dtx' through LaTeX to get the documentation
   (`metre.ind'	must be in the same directory as `metre.dtx').

   By default, only the first part of the file (the user guide) is
   processed; if you are interested in the code, follow the
   instructions	near the beginning of `metre.dtx'.

4) Run LaTeX on `demo.tex' to verify the installation.

5) To process `greek1.tex', `greek2.tex' and `greek3.tex' you must
   have Babel installed, with the `polutonikogreek' option. 
   To process `igreek1.tex', `igreek2.tex' and `igreek3.tex'
   you must have Ibycus4 installed.
