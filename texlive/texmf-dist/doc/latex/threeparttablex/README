This small package brings tablenotes to longtable, though using a
slightly different syntax.

By default it does not change anything in theeparttable.

If asked for (using the referable package option), we change some
threeparttable internals such that table notes are referable, i.e.

\item[a] \label{tn:a} some text

then \ref{tn:a} gives you an 'a' (without any formatting). Instead of
manually keeping track of all the \tnote arguments in the table you
can now do \tnotex{tn:a} to get \tnote{\ref{tn:a}}. 

For information on how to use threeparttable with longtable see the manual.
