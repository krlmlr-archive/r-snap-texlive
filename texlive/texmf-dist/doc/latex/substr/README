substr.sty

This package provides commands to deal with substrings in strings:
Determine if a string contains a substring, count appearances of a
substring in a string.


The Description of the commands can be found in the file substr.sty.



History of this package:

The package arises from a posting of me in the newsgroup
de.comp.text.tex in which I asked how to find out if a substring
is included in a string. Heiko Oberdiek
<oberdiek@ruf.uni-freiburg.de> posted the commands
\IfSubStringInString and \IfCharInString and suggested to write a
command which counts the appearances in a string. So, I wrote the
commands \CountSubStrings and \setcountertoSubStrings.
After I wrote this package I sent it to Heiko Oberdiek
who improved and rewrote many parts of it.
