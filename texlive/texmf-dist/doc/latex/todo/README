The todo package, version 2.4142

todo provides macros for users to insert reminders in their
documents for tasks 'to do', which will then be shown as a list
at the end of the document.

Version 2.4142 fixes bugs and adds extra functionality (quiet
todos, verbose todos, a new environment for full flexibility,
and a \done command to mark todos as 'done').
