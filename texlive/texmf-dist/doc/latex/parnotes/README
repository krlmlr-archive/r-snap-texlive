The parnotes package adds a new note type, \parnote. Parnotes are set as
normal, running paragraphs and may be placed two ways: (1) Automatically,
at the end of the paragraph (2) Manually, using the \parnotes command.

To place notes automatically after every paragraph, use the autopn
environment:
    \begin{autopn}
    Text\parnote{parnote}

    Text
    \end{autopn}
If environments are used within autopn, another autopn environment must be
nested within them. To place notes elsewhere, use the \parnotes command.
