\paragraph{Overview.}
The package {\sffamily chkfloat} provides one single feature.
It shows a warning whenever a float is placed more than \verb:tolerance: pages from its orinigal page.

\paragraph{Interference.}
The package should interfere well with other float-related packages like {\sffamily float} or {\sffamily floatrow}.
If any problem is spotted, feel free to contact the package author.

\paragraph{Package options.}
The package has a single option \verb:tolerance: which is preset to \verb:1:.
To change the value, use e.g. \verb:\usepackage[tolerance=0]{chkfloat}:.

\paragraph{Implementation.}
The package code is documented.
The implementation is based on the macros that create `List of Figures' and similar lists.
A new fake list is created with file extension \verb:.fof: and we store the information
 about each float's ``original'' page and ``final'' page.
On the next run, these lines are loaded and processed.

\paragraph{Version history.}
Version 0.1 is the first version.
