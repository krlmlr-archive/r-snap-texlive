The polynom package implements macros for manipulating
polynomials. For example, it can typeset polynomial long
divisions and synthetic divisions (Horner's scheme). The
main test case and application is the polynomial ring in
one variable with rational coefficients.
Please note that this is work in progress. Multivariate
polynomials are currently not supported.
