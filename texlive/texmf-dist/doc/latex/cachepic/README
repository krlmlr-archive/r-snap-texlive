The purpose of cachepic package is to simplify and automate conversion 
of document fragments into external EPS or PDF file(s). The package 
consists of two parts: the LaTeX2e style implementing the document 
level interface and a command line tool (written in Lua) for generation 
of external graphics. 

The inclusion of already generated graphics requires only the 
cachepic.sty style file and two standard packages: graphicx (obviously) 
and verbatim (for its comment environment). Both should be present in 
every LaTeX distribution.
