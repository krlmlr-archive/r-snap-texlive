The regexpatch package generalizes the macro patching commands
provided by P. Lehmann's `etoolbox'. The difference between this
package and its sibling `xpatch' is that this package sports a very
powerful `\regexpatchcmd' based on the `l3regex' module of LaTeX3
experimental packages.

In this version the code and the documentation have been polished;
the `biblatex' related macros already in `xpatch' have been added
also to `regexpatch'.

This is version 0.2 of the package
