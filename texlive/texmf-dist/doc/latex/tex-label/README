== About tex-label

This package can be used to label pages of a document just like
labelling e-mail to classify them. This is useful when you are
preparing notes and you want to sort through pages quickly looking for
keywords.

Currently, the labels are displayed at the bottom-right corner of
pages.

== Setup

Copy tex-label.sty to a place where latex can find it.
