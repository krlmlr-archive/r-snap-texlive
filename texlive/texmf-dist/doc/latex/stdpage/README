The stdpage package produces a standard page with an adjustable
number of lines per page, with an adjustable maximum number of
characters each. Those pages are used to calculate the standard
length or the price of translations, proof reading or journal
contributions. In Germany the "Normseite" of 30 lines and at most 60
characters per line is very widespread. So if you have to find out
how many "standard pages" a LaTeX text has, you just add one line of
code and get well typeset typewriterpages.

Version 0.5 additionally supports baselinestretch, parskip and
suppressing of hyphenation.

Version 0.6 fixes some important bugs and adds an option to get the
real typewriter look!
