"Progress" is a package which when compiling LaTeX documents,
generates a HTML file giving an overview of the documents state (of how finished its parts are).

The package is highly configurable, enabling the users to get and control textural and graphical progress information in their documents. Finally the package has the notion of "draft" and "final" documents, so progress meters can be removed easily.
