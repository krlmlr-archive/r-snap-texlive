Purpose
This package, along with tikz, will typeset block diagrams for
use with programming and control theory.  

Contributions
This is just an English translation of the schemabloc package. 
I did fix a couple of bugs that I found in the schemabloc 
package so that blox works for the MikTeX installation I have.
