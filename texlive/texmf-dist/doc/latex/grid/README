grid packages helps to enable grid typesetting (ie, vertically
aligning lines of text in adjacent columns) in double column
documents in LaTeX.

The manifest.txt provides the list of files in grid package.

A small uer manual and examples are provided in grid.tex which can be
tyeset with pdfLaTeX. A Makefile is provided for GNU/Linux users who
can accomplish the job by invoking the following command at the
prompt:

or

  make pdf

  make pdf

This will create grid.pdf with all bells and whistles.
