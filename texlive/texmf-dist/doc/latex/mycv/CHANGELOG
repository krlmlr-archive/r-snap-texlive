    [c] Name and date of main files are now
        extracted from my SVN repository so
        as to prevent future oversights.

        base directory to "*.def".

Sat Apr 28 13:19:33 CEST 2012 -- Version <1.5.4>
================================================

    [x] Fixed a bug in the file name regex
        that could yield a LaTeX error when
        used along with optional arguments
        of a command.

    [+] Added a new example of usage (also
        did some changes to the old ones)
        and updated the doc accordingly.

    [c] Changed the extension (from .def to
        .sty) of the files 'mycv_dec.*' and
        'mycv_style.*'.

    [c] Modified the default geometry of a
        document and did other minor changes
        to the style file.

================================================
Sun May 13 18:53:30 CEST 2012 -- Version <1.5.5>
================================================

    [x] Fixed a missing package that prevented
        the 'mycv_dec' package from being loaded
        independently from the class.

    [+] Added a Perl script to split CV contents
        from one single file to multiple files
        (see the doc for further details).

    [+] Added a new example of usage and did
        code refactoring of the old ones.

    [c] Updated the documentation to reflect
        the changes done and also tried to
        fix its english (as far as I can do
        that).

    [c] Other minor changes.

================================================
Sun May 20 21:32:11 CEST 2012 -- Version <1.5.6>
================================================

    [c] Changed the way of distribution of the
        package. Now it comes out with two dtx
        files (created automatically) for the
        class's sources and examples.

    [c] Merged all the files of the doc into
        one single file (done automatically).
        In the file 'mycv.dtx' is explained
        why a dtx was not used for the doc.

    [+] Added a Perl script (checksum.pl) to
        check the integrity of the main files.
