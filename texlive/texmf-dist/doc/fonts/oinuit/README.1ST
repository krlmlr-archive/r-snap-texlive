The ``oinuit'' system is a set of Lambda (Omega LaTeX) typesetting tools for 
the Inuktitut language. The ``oinuit'' package supports five different 
input methods and is bundled with the necessary fonts. To learn more about
the system, typeset with LaTeX the file omega/oinuit.dtx; to get the system
files run LaTeX on file omega/oinuit.ins. To install the package:

1) Create the directories 
   a) texmf/omega/ocp/oinuit
   b) texmf/omega/otp/oinuit
   c) texmf/omega/lambda/oinuit
   d) texmf/fonts/ovf/public/oinuit
   e) texmf/fonts/ofm/public/oinuit
   f) texmf/fonts/type1/public/oinuit
   g) texmf/dvips/oinuit

2) Copy to directory c) all the *.sty, *.fd, *.def and *.tex files generated
   by running LaTeX on file oinuit.ins. The *.otp files generated with the
   same process should be installed on directory b).

3) Copy all the font files to the corresponding directories.

4) Append the following line 

   inuit inuit.tex

   to file texmf/omega/lambda/base/language.dat and regenarate the Lambda
   format so that the Inuktitut hyphenation patterns can be loaded.

5) Copy the *.ocp files to directory a). 

6) Copy the file oinuit.map to directory g).

7) Rehash your system and make sure that you can process the examples.
