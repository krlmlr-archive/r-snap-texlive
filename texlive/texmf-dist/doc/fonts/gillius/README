This is the README for the gillius package, version 2013-11-03.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX support
for the Gillius and Gillius No. 2 families of sans serif fonts and
condensed versions of them, designed by Hirwen Harendal. According
to the designer, the fonts were inspired by Gill Sans.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system unzip the
file tex-archive/install/fonts/gillius.tds.zip at the root of
an appropriate texmf tree, likely a personal or local tree. If
necessary, update the file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the
font-map files by enabling the Map file gillius.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{gillius}

or

\usepackage{gillius2}

to the preamble of your document. These make Gillius (or 
Gillius No. 2) the default sans family. To also set them as the main
text font, use the option sfdefault.

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish
to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

The condensed option loads the condensed variants.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to adjust
fontsizes to match a serifed font.

The only figure style supported is proportional-lining. Font
encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

Commands \gillius, \gilliustwo, \gilliuscondensed and
\gilliustwocondensed select the specified font family.

The original fonts (version 1.009) were downloaded from
http://arkandis.tuxfamily.org/adffonts.html and are licensed under
the GPL License, (version 2 or later), with font exception; the text
may be found in the doc directory. The type1 versions were created
using cfftot1. The support files were created using autoinst and are

maintainer of this package is Bob Tennent (rdt at cs.queensu.ca)
