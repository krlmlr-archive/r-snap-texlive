(README changed 09/06/99; conditions relaxed)

28/06/91  As a concession to those who for some reason don't have Metafont,
the following files are now included: teng10.tfm and cirth.tfm (the font
metric files), and {teng10,cirth}.pk{300,360} (the pk files generated
with mode imagen (i.e. Laserwriter) at normal size and at magstep 1).

*** Important Note ***

These files are copyright (c) 1987 J.C. Bradfield.
They are distributed on the following conditions:
 (a) You may use the source and generated fonts for any purpose,
     and may distribute the files, provided that all files including
     this copyright notice remain intact.
 (b) You may make modifications for your own use. You may distribute
     modified versions of these files PROVIDED that this copyright
     notice remains intact AND that you include the original files
     clearly labelled as such.
     If you produce modifications that seem useful, you are asked to
     send them to me, so that they can be incorporated into the master
     files.

There are still things I would like to do with these fonts, in
particular, to provide virtual fonts for Quenya etc. If you have
suggestions or comments, please contact me.

******************************************

The only file that needs to be input is teng10.mf ; all the other
files are called by it. Hence, on a Unix system, the following 
should generate a tengwar font at magnification \magstep1 for
the Apple Laserwriter:
mf '\mode:=imagen; mag := magstep1; input teng10'

If you have difficulties, contact your local Metafont guru in
the first instance.

*****************************************

The cirth font is rather hastily put together, and is not properly
organized as yet. It is therefore distributed as a single stand-alone
file, so again all you have to do is:
mf '\mode:=imagen; mag := magstep1; input cirth'

*****************************************

The file teng.tex contains the macros I use for setting tenwar
when using TeX. I'm afraid they're not commented---tough! The general
idea is that the ^ character is used to put a vowel over its consonant,
so for example to print 
 Ai! laurie lantar lassi s\'urinen
in tengwar, I would type
{\quenya ^Ia l^Ua^ri^@e ^la^DaR ^la^Zi s^*u^ri^nen}

You'll have to note which ASCII character corresponds to which
tengwa for yourself; I don't have a table prepared. A point to watch
out for is that in Quenya, 'v' usually transcribes vilya, which is 
represented by the ASCII character  w ;  v  represents the tengwa
amba  (i.e. the encoding is basically set up for use with English).
