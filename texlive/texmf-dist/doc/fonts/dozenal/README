dozenal provides macros and characters in a variety of
styles and sizes, designed to blend with the Computer Modern
family, for typesetting dozenal documents.  It employs the
\basexii algorithm by David Kastrup.

This document should run properly on any properly running LaTeX
system.  It's been tested specifically with TeXLive on Linux (2.6.2
kernel).

This is version 3.3 of dozenal.

For version 1.1, minor bugs, in which section and subsection
numbers were not properly redefined, have been fixed.

For version 1.2, support for using dozenal characters in
math mode was added.  Submitted to CTAN on 6 June 2009.

For version 1.3, \mainmatter's slaughter of the dozenal
counter redefinitions was stopped.  Submitted to CTAN on 20
June 2009.

For version 2.0, Type 1 versions of the fonts were uploaded.
Some trouble with the normal weight italic, which is
therefore replaced with the simple slanted version.  Was
annoyed at having to do this at all; only did it because
acroread is terrible and won't display bitmap fonts
properly.  Submitted to CTAN on 2 July 2009.

For version 3.0, I was kindly informed that my \x was
actually a backwards Pitman ten; so I fixed that, which
included redrawing the italics font (the rest were simply
mirrored).  Also, made the version numbers "real" by
including them in the \ProvidesPackage command; thanks to
Robin Fairbairns for telling me to.

For version 3.1, I've updated things to allow TeXLive to
install the package correctly automatically; previously,
some manual work was required.  This was essentially just
adding a \pdfmapfile statement to dozenal.sty.  Submitted to
CTAN on 25 November 2009.

For version 3.2, I've made minor changes because a new
version of hyperref for some reason seemed to break things,
for reasons that aren't really clear to me.  Submitted to
CTAN on 13 May 2012.

For version 3.3, I was kindly notified by Karl Berry that
the Type 1 italic TFM wasn't properly formed; I switched
from mftrace to mf2pt1 for converting from Metafont, and
this seems to have resolved the problem.  Submitted to CTAN
on 3 Nov 11E8 (decimal 2012).

For version 4.0, I've included the tally mark characters, as
well, for whatever they may be worth.  The documentation
also now contains examples of the characters.  Submitted to
CTAN on 17 May 11E9 (decimal 19 May 2013).
