Overview 
========

This package includes the VenturisADF font collection in postscript type 1
format, LaTeX support files and documentation.

Opentype versions of the fonts are also available (see below).


Copyright and licensing 
=======================

Fonts 
-----

The Venturis Collection consists of fonts made by Arkandis Digital Foundry
(ADF), collectively known as the "Software", currently maintained by ADF.  As
the Software is modified from Utopia fonts, they are under the same license as
the Utopia fonts themselves (see LICENSE-utopia.txt).  That is, Akandis Digital
Foundry hereby grants the TeX Users Group and any and all other interested
parties the rights enumerated in the Utopia license.

As Venturis is a trademark of Arkandis Digital Foundry, any modified versions
of Software shall not use the font name(s) or trademark(s), in whole or in
part, unless explicit written permission is granted by ADF as described in the
initial license.

The following changes have been made to the standard Venturis Collection font
files in preparing this package for use with (La)TeX:
- the postscript versions of the fonts have been renamed according to the Karl
  Berry fontname scheme;
- the opentype fonts have been removed from the package.

TeX/LaTeX support files and documentation
-----------------------------------------

As explained in comments at the top of each file, many of the encoding (.etx)
files are based on standard fontinst files such as t1.etx and ts1.etx.
Modifications are copyright 2010 Clea F. Rees (see below).

Code from t1.etx copyright 2005 Alan Jeffrey and Sebastian Rahtz and Ulrik
Vieth and Lars Hellstr{\"o}m (see below).

Code from ts1.etx copyright 2005 Sebastian Rahtz and Ulrik Vieth and Lars
Hellstr{\"o}m (see below).

This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.

The following changes have been made to the standard Venturis Collection
documentation in preparing this package:
- a new README (this file) has replaced the original README, incorporating both
  relevant parts of the original and additional information concerning TeX/LaTeX
  support
- LIST-Venturis.txt has been edited to reflect the Karl Berry fontname scheme
  used for the postscript type 1 fonts (see below) and to update the date,
  version and font list, as appropriate.

The following files are derived works under the terms of the LPPL:

lining.etx

TeX/LaTeX support files and documentation
-----------------------------------------

The LaTeX support files, unlike the fonts themselves, are still somewhat
experimental. Although I don't think they will persuade your cat to revolt
(how many cats need persuading?) or drink all your tea, things may not work as
advertised. If you find bugs, please let me know. I will fix them if I can. If
you know how to fix them, please tell me as this greatly increases the chances
of the "if I can" condition being satisfied.


Installation and use 
====================

TeX/LaTeX support 
-----------------

See included documentation, venturisadf.pdf, for information regarding (La)TeX
support. The documentation source, venturisadf.tex uses various other
packages. These are all standard and available from CTAN but may be commented
out if preferred.

The LaTeX packages (venturis, venturis2 and venturisold) require xkeyval and
nfssext-cfr, available from CTAN.
