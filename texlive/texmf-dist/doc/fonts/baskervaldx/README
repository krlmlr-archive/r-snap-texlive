Changes from BaskervaldADF Std
------------------------------
0. Regular and bold weights only. 
1. Roman xheights increased, ascenders decreased.
2. Adjusted most symbols used in mathematical typesetting, as the originals do not seem
to have been designed to accommodate the needs of TeX.
3. Added fixed width lining and oldstyle figures, plus proportional oldstyle figures in
each of the four styles.
4. Adjusted metrics and shapes of ligatures for more consistent spacing.
5. Adjusted metrics and kerning of most uppercase letters so they are less packed.
6. Added small caps in all four styles.
7. Added many accented glyphs so that the only characters missing in T1 encoding are Eng and eng.
