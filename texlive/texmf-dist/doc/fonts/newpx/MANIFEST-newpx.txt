This package contains slight extensions of the GUST TeXGyrePagella fonts, adding a full set of superior figures to regular weight roman. The newly generated type1 fonts are:

TeXGyrePagellaX-Bold.pfb
TeXGyrePagellaX-BoldItalic.pfb
TeXGyrePagellaX-Italic.pfb
TeXGyrePagellaX-Regular.pfb

from which all the newpxtext font metrics were derived. In addition, 6 glyphs from TeXGyrePagellaMath-Regular.otf were use to make two type1 fonts:

zplx-regular.pfb
zplx-bold.pfb

and these were used as ingredients in newpxmath.
