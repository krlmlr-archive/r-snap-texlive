cugar10.pfb
cugar10.tfm

    To install the bundle:
o If you want MetaFont sources uncomment the appropriate lines in ugarite.ins.
o run: latex ugarite.ins, which will generate:
       ugarite.sty
       *.fd files
       ugarite.map
       and possibly cugar10.mf
o Move *.sty and *.fd files to a location where LaTeX will find them
    e.g., .../texmf-local/tex/latex/ugarite
o Move *.afm, *.pfb and *.tfm files to where LaTeX looks for font information
    e.g., .../texmf-var/fonts/afm/public/archaic/*.afm
          .../texmf-var/fonts/type1/public/archaic/*.pfb
          .../texmf-var/fonts/tfm/public/archaic/*.tfm
o Add the *.map information to the dvips/pdftex font maps
   If you want the MetaFont version as well:
   o Move the *.mf files to, e.g., .../texmf-var/fonts/source/public/ugarite
   o Add a line like the following to the (texmf/fontname/)special.map file:
     cugar10.mf    public      ugarite 
o Refresh the database
 (for more information on the above see the FAQ).

o run: (pdf)latex tryugarite for a test of the font

    If you want a full manual with all the MetaFont and LaTeX code and commentry, 
comment out the \OnlyDescription line in ugarite.dtx.
o run: (pdf)latex ugarite.dtx
o (for an index run: makeindex -s gind.ist *.idx)
o run: (pdf)latex *.dtx
o Print *.(pdf|dvi) for a hardcopy of the package manual
