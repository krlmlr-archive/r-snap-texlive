    The hieroglf bundle provides a Postscript Type1 version of about 80
Egyptian hieroglyphs from Serge Rosmorduc's comprehensive hieroglyph 
package. Hieroglyphic writing was used between about 3000 BC and 400 AD.
Sufficient glyphs are provided for writing a few names like 
Cleopatra and Ptomemy (together with cartouches), and there is a
command for transliterating into a modern alphabet. The bundle
is not for serious Egyptologists.

    The bundle is one of a series for archiac scripts.

    The hieroglf package requires the oands package for some symbols
used in the transliteration.

     The distribution consists of the following files:
README (this file)
hieroglf.dtx
hieroglf.ins
hieroglf.pdf     (user manual)
trypmhg.tex      (example usage)
trypmhg.pdf

    To install the package:
o run: latex hieroglf.ins, which will generate:
       hieroglf.sty
       *.fd files
       hieroglf.map
o Move *.sty and *.fd files to a location where LaTeX will find them
    e.g., .../texmf-local/tex/latex/hieroglf
o Move *.afm, *.pfb and *.tfm files to where LaTeX looks for font information
    e.g., .../texmf-var/fonts/afm/public/archaic/*.afm
          .../texmf-var/fonts/type1/public/archaic/*.pfb
          .../texmf-var/fonts/tfm/public/archaic/*.tfm
o Add the *.map information to the dvips/pdftex font maps
o Refresh the database
 (for more information on the above see the FAQ).

o run: (pdf)latex trypmhg for a test of the font

    To generate a second copy of the manual (which is already supplied as a PDF file):
o run: latex hieroglf.dtx
o (for an index run: makeindex -s gind.ist *.idx)
o run: latex *.dtx
o Print *.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual
