    To install the bundle:
o run: latex oands.ins, which will generate:
       oands.sty
       *.fd files
       oands.map
o Move *.sty and *.fd files to a location where LaTeX will find them
    e.g., .../texmf-local/tex/latex/oands
o Move *.afm, *.pfb and *.tfm files to where LaTeX looks for font information
    e.g., .../texmf-var/fonts/afm/public/archaic/*.afm
          .../texmf-var/fonts/type1/public/archaic/*.pfb
          .../texmf-var/fonts/tfm/public/archaic/*.tfm
o Add the *.map information to the dvips/pdftex font maps
o Refresh the database
 (for more information on the above see the FAQ).

o run: (pdf)latex tryoands for a test of the font

    To generate a second copy of the manual (which is already supplied as a PDF file):
o run: latex oands.dtx
o (for an index run: makeindex -s gind.ist *.idx)
o run: latex *.dtx
o Print *.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual
