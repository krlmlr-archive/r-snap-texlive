    The sarabian bundle provides fonts for the South Arabian script, in use for 
about 1000 years from roughly 600 BC, together with appropriate files for
using them with LaTeX. The glyphs are the work of Alan Stanier.
This is one of a series of ancient scripts.

o run: latex sarabian.ins, which will generate:
       sarabian.sty
       *.fd files
       sarabian.map
       and possibly sarab10.mf
o Move *.sty and *.fd files to a location where LaTeX will find them
    e.g., .../texmf-local/tex/latex/sarabian
o Move *.afm, *.pfb and *.tfm files to where LaTeX looks for font information
    e.g., .../texmf-var/fonts/afm/public/archaic/*.afm
          .../texmf-var/fonts/type1/public/archaic/*.pfb
          .../texmf-var/fonts/tfm/public/archaic/*.tfm
o Add the *.map information to the dvips/pdftex font maps
   If you want the MetaFont version as well:
   o Move the *.mf files to, e.g., .../texmf-var/fonts/source/public/sarabian
   o Add a line like the following to the (texmf/fontname/)special.map file:
     sarab10.mf    public      sarabian 
o Refresh the database
 (for more information on the above see the FAQ).

o run: (pdf)latex trysarabian for a test of the font

    If you want a full manual with all the MetaFont and LaTeX code and commentry, 
comment out the \OnlyDescription line in sarabian.dtx.
o run: (pdf)latex sarabian.dtx
o (for an index run: makeindex -s gind.ist sarabian.idx)
