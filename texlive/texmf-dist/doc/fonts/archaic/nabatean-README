    To install the bundle:
o If you want MetaFont sources uncomment the appropriate lines in nabatean.ins.
o run: latex nabatean.ins, which will generate:
       nabatean.sty
       *.fd files
       nabatean.map
       and possibly nab10.mf
o Move *.sty and *.fd files to a location where LaTeX will find them
    e.g., .../texmf-local/tex/latex/nabatean
o Move *.afm, *.pfb and *.tfm files to where LaTeX looks for font information
    e.g., .../texmf-var/fonts/afm/public/archaic/*.afm
          .../texmf-var/fonts/type1/public/archaic/*.pfb
          .../texmf-var/fonts/tfm/public/archaic/*.tfm
o Add the *.map information to the dvips/pdftex font maps
   If you want the MetaFont version as well:
   o Move the *.mf files to, e.g., .../texmf-var/fonts/source/public/nabatean
   o Add a line like the following to the (texmf/fontname/)special.map file:
     nab10.mf    public      nabatean 
o Refresh the database
 (for more information on the above see the FAQ).

o run: (pdf)latex trynabatean for a test of the font

    If you want a full manual with all the MetaFont and LaTeX code and commentry, 
comment out the \OnlyDescription line in nabatean.dtx.
o run: (pdf)latex nabatean.dtx
o (for an index run: makeindex -s gind.ist *.idx)
o run: (pdf)latex *.dtx
o Print *.(pdf|dvi) for a hardcopy of the package manual

    The protosem package provides fonts for the Proto-Semitic script in use 
about 1600 BC, and which may have been a very early ancestor of many of the 
world's alphabets. Files for using the font with LaTeX are also included.
This is one of a series of ancient fonts.

    The distribution consists of the following files:
README (this file)
protosem.ins
protosem.dtx
tryfont.tex

    The distribution is provided under the terms of the LaTeX
Project Public License (LPPL).

Changes in version 1.1
----------------------
o Minor changes to the glyph encoding to match other fonts in the series

    To install the package:
o run: latex protosem.ins, which will generate:
       proto*.mf files
       *.fd files
       protosem.sty
o run: latex protosem.dtx
o run: makeindex -s gind.ist protosem
o run: latex protosem.dtx
o Print protosem.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual 
o Move the generated files to locations where LaTeX will find them.
    For example: the *.fd and .sty files to .../local/texmf/tex/latex/protosem
                 the proto*.mf files to .../texmf/fonts/source/public/protosem
    On a teTeX distribution you might also have to add the following 
    line to texmf/fontname/special.map:
      proto10.mf     public    protosem
    On a teTeX distribution remember to run texhash after moving the files.

o run: latex tryfont  for a testpage of the Proto-Semitic font
