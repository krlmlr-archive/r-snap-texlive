Changes in 1.04
1. Corrected the code to eliminate an unwanted space following the footnote mark.

Changes in 1.03:
1. Changed code so that footnotes within minipages are not handled using superior figures, but use whatever was determined by \thempfootnote and the existing \@makefnmark.

Changes in 1.02:
1. libertinesups now points to a snapshot taken from LinLibertineO, and no longer depends on any other Libertine package.

The package provides one superior figures font drawn from the Linux Libertine collection---installation requires enabling superiors.map. The default superior figures font is distributed with newtx, and provides figures based on STIX superior figures, compatible with Times and other heavy fonts.

Any existing fonts collection, such as might be constructed by otfinst, may be used provided it has a complete set of superior digits.
