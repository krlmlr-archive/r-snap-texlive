This is the README for the fira package, version 2014-03-16.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX support
for the Fira Sans family of fonts (version 2.001), designed by Erik
Spiekermann and Ralph du Carrois of Carrois Type Design. Fira Sans
is available in four weights with corresponding italics: light,
regular, medium, and bold.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system download the
file "tex-archive"/install/fonts/fira.tds.zip where the preferred
URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirrors.ctan.org. Unzip the archive
at the root of an appropriate texmf tree, likely a personal or local
tree. If necessary, update the file-name database (e.g., texhash).
Update the font-map files by enabling the Map file fira.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{FiraSans}

to the preamble of your document. These will activate Fira Sans as
the sans-serif text font. To activate it as the main text font, use

\usepackage[sfdefault]{FiraSans}

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish
to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the
fonts.

The default figure style is proportional-oldstyle, but the lining
(or lf) option will change the default to lining figures and
the tabular (or tf) option will change the default to tabular
(monospaced) figures. 

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

The medium option activates that series as the default bold series.
The light option activates that series as the default regular
series.

Commands \firaoldstyle, \firalining, \firatabular, and
\firaproportional allow for localized use of non-default figures.
Superior numbers are available using \sufigures. Commands \firalight
and \firamedium allow for localized use of those series.

The original OpenType fonts were obtained from

and are licensed under the SIL Open Font License, version 1.1;
the text may be found in the doc directory. The type1 versions
were created using autoinst. The support files were created using
