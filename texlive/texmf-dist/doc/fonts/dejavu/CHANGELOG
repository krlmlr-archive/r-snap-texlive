This is the changelog of the LaTeX package, not the fonts.


2013-09-23
----------

- Updated the fonts to version 2.34.


2013-01-10
----------

- Changed the Em Size in the Type 1 version of the fonts
	from non-standard value 2048 to 1000. There was
	weird spacing of letters when xelatex used Type 1
	version of DejaVu fonts, lualatex was Ok. Problem
	reported by Felix Lehmann.


2011-11-03
----------

- Added the missing font DejaVu Sans ExtraLight (requested by
	Pander).


2011-09-14
----------

- Added extra kerning pairs between the Greek accents and the
	capital Greek letters for the serif and sans serif
	families (the monospaced family left unchanged). The
	kerning values are generated from the fonts (sfd files)
	and the combination accent + letter should give the
	same relative position of accent and letter as in the
	precomposed accented capital Greek letters. Most kerning
	values are big negative, but there are also several
	small positive values.

- Small changes in the LGR encoding: uni1FBD replaced by uni1FBF
	and grave replaced by uni1FEF. They have exactly the same
	glyph, but are more consistent with the Greek alphabet.
	These should be user invisible changes.


2011-08-24
----------

- Added the QX encoding (requested by Mojca Miklavec).

- Added the LGR encoding (it may be usable as it is, but
	I think that it needs an improvement--see the
	documentation).

- I moved the documentation of the fonts to its own subdirectory.


2011-08-09 (font version 2.33)
-------------------------

- First public release.
