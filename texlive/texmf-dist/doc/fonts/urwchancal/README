This is a mathematical script/calligraphic virtual font based on the URW clone of Zapf Chancery. 

Install the TDS in the usual way. There is no map file to enable. 

The effect of 

\usepackage[scaled=.9]{urwchancal}

is to redefine \mathcal to invoke the appropriate size of urwchancal scaled by the factor .9. The option mathscr instead redefines \mathscr to do the same thing without affecting \mathcal.

The virtual font urwchancal was produced using fontinst from the raw text font uzcmi8r, with adjustments to the font metrics in accordance with my tastes in side-bearings, accent placement and subscript position.
