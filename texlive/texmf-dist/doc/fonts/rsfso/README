Version 1.01, 2013-11-02

IMPORTANT: Before installing this package, the rsfs package with PostScript fonts must be installed (it is part of TeXLive), and rsfs.map must be enabled.

This is a variant of the rsfs script font package and will not function in its absence. It allows the use of the rsfs fonts as the bases for virtual fonts which render the rsfs glyphs with a much smaller slant, so they appear stylistically close to the script font mh2scr in the Adobe Mathematical Pi collection.

After installing the TDS in the usual way, the map file must be enabled. For example, in TeXLive, if you installed the package in texmflocal and have no personal updmap.cfg,

sudo -H updmap-sys --enable Map=rsfso.map

following which the effect of 

\usepackage[scaled=.9]{rsfso}

is to redefine \mathcal to invoke the appropriate size of rsfso scaled by the factor .9.

The effect of

\usepackage[scr]{rsfso}

is to redefine \mathscr rather than \mathcal to invoke the appropriate size of rsfso.

The virtual fonts rsfso10, rsfso7 and rsfso5 were produced using fontinst from the raw text fonts rrsfso10, rrsfso7 and rrsfso5, with adjustments to the font metrics in accordance with my tastes in side-bearings, accent placement and subscript position.
