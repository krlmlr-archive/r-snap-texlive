Readme for the 'fouriernc' package

This package provides a LaTeX math font setup for
NC Schoolbook. In order to use it you need to have
the Fourier-GUTenberg fonts installed.

To install the package, copy
  *.tfm into localtexmf/fonts/tfm/public/fouriernc
  *.vf  into localtexmf/fonts/vf/public/fouriernc
  *.sty and *.fd into localtexmf/tex/latex/fouriernc
and run mktexlsr afterwards.

Issue
  \usepackage{fouriernc}
in your document's preamble to set the math and serif text fonts.
No extra documentation is provided, the usage is analogue
to fourier's documentation.
The metrics for the 'upright' option have not been tuned, thus
this option is disabled.

Future changes:
The metrics refer to fourier v1.4, future versions of fourier
may require a rebuild of the fouriernc metrics and possibly changes
to specialkernings.mtx/specialkerningsital.mtx.

Correction to build-fouriernc.tex (line 22) and fncmib.{tfm,vf} by Michael Sharpe 2013-04-02 so that bold Greek symbols now work as expected.
