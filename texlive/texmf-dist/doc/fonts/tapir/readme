The 'Tapir' is a simple geometrical font mostly created of line and circular segments with constant thickness.
The character set contains all characters in the range 0--127 (as in cmr10), accented characters used
in czech, slovak and polish language.

There are some other characters which are not created and encoded by default. To use them create your own encoding
(see 'tap-enc.mf'). Full list of available symbols can be obtained by

                       grep "iff known" tap.mf | sed -e "s/iff known \(.*\):/\1/"

The set of symbols contains accented latin-based characters (identifiers beginning 'latin_') and some special symbols
(identifiers beginning 'sign_'). Download the Type1 font with all characters from my web page.


Installation:
1) copy tap.mf into appropriate directory (e.g. texmf/fonts/source/public/tapir)
2) copy tap.pfb into appropriate directory (e.g. texmf/fonts/type1/public/tapir)
3) add line `tap Tapir <tap.pfb' into dvips map file (e.g. texmf/dvips/config/psfonts.map)
4) refresh TeX database (mktexlsr)

Testing of installation:
1) run `tex testfont'
2) enter `tap'
3) enter `\table\end'
4) view testfont.dvi

Usage:
1) put `\font\tapir tap' into your document
2) use as `{\tapir My text}'

Notes:
1) There are some parameters on the beginning of `tap.mf' file. You can change them but the result is not predictable.
2) There is a boolean parameter 'serifs'. When it is set 'true' by running METAFONT with
                               boolean serifs; serifs:=true; input tap
   lowercase letters will have upper serifs.
3) Simple italic version can be made via `boolean italic; italic:=true; slant:=.25; input tap'. Only letters `a' and `g'
   have different look.
