 The linearA package provides a simple interface to two
 fonts which include all known symbols, simple and complex, of the Linear A
 script. This way one can easily replicate Linear A ``texts'' using modern
 typographic technology. Notice that the Linear A script has not been
 deciphered yet and probably it will never be deciphered.
