The FPL Fonts consist of the following four fonts:

fplrc8a.pfb   TeXPalladioL-SC
fplrij8a.pfb  TeXPalladioL-ItalicOsF
fplbj8a.pfb   TeXPalladioL-BoldOsF
fplbij8a.pfb  TeXPalladioL-BoldItalicOsF

The FPL Fonts provide a set of SC/OsF fonts for URW Palladio L which are
compatible with respect to metrics with the Palatino SC/OsF fonts from
Adobe. Note that it is not my aim to exactly reproduce the outlines of
the original Adobe fonts. The SC and OsF in the FPL Fonts were designed
with the glyphs from URW Palladio L as starting point. For some glyphs
(eg 'o') I got the best result by scaling and boldening. For others (eg
'h') shifting selected portions of the character gave more satisfying
results. All this was done using the free font editor FontForge
<URL:http://fontforge.sf.net>. The kerning data in these fonts comes
from Walter Schmidt's improved Palatino metrics.


History
-------

Version 1.002 2005-02-13 
        * no div operator (compatibility problems)

        * no references (compatibility problems)

	First official release


Deficiencies
------------

On the character level only automatic hinting as done by FontForge has
been applied to the SC and OsF glyphs.


Usage with LaTeX
----------------

As the FPL Fonts have the same metrics as their Adobe counterparts, the
improved Palatino metrics by Walter Schmidt can be used. They are part
of PSNFSS 9.2, which can be found on CTAN:macros/latex/required/psnfss/.
Therefore, it is best to update your TeX distribution to a version which
provides PSNFSS 9.2. The usage with LaTeX is documented in psnfss2e.pdf.
Please follow the installation instruction from PSNFSS, if you want to
upgrade PSNFSS only.
