This is the README for the accanthis package, version 2013-11-05.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX support
for the Accanthis No. 3 family of fonts, designed by Hirwin
Harendal. This font is suitable as an alternative to fonts such as
Garamond, Galliard, Horley Old Style, Sabon and Bembo.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system download the file
tex-archive/install/fonts/accanthis.tds.zip and unzip at the
root of an appropriate texmf tree, likely a personal or local tree. If
necessary, update the file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the
font-map files by enabling the Map file accanthis.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{accanthis}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate Accanthis No. 3
as the main (serifed) text font. 

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish to
avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the
fonts.

The only figure style is proportional-lining.

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

Command \accanthis selects the Accanthis No. 3 family. 

The original fonts (version 1.008) were obtained from

type1 versions were created using cfftot1. The support files were
created using autoinst and are licensed under the terms of the
