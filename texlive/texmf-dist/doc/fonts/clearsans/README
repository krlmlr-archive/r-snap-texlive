This is the README for the clearsans package, version 2014-05-28.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX support
for the Clear Sans family of fonts (version 1.0), designed by Daniel
Ratighan at Monotype for Intel. Clear Sans is available in three
weights (regular, medium, and bold) with corresponding italics, plus
light and thin upright (without italics).

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system download
the file "tex-archive"/install/fonts/clearsans.tds.zip where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirrors.ctan.org. Unzip
the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree, likely a
personal or local tree. If necessary, update the file-name database
(e.g., texhash). Update the font-map files by enabling the Map file
ClearSans.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{ClearSans}

to the preamble of your document. These will activate Clear Sans as
the sans-serif text font. To activate it as the main text font, use

\usepackage[sfdefault]{ClearSans}

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish
to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the
fonts.

The only figure style is proportional-lining.

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

The medium option activates that series as the default bold series.

Commands \clearsans, \clearlight (or textsfl{...}) and \clearthin
(or \textsft{...}) allow for localized use of Clear Sans and the
light and thin variants, respectively.

The original TrueType fonts were obtained from

https://01.org/clear-sans

and are licensed under the Apache License, version 2.0; the text
may be found in the doc directory. The type1 versions were created
using autoinst. The support files were created using autoinst and
are licensed under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public License.
The maintainer of this package is Bob Tennent (rdt at cs.queensu.ca)
