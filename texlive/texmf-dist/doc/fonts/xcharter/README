Current version: 1.05

Changes in version 1.05
1. Slight modifications of control points of some oldstyle figures.
2. Modified kerning tables for P-period, P-comma and P-hyphen in all styles, all existing ones appearing much too tight.
3. Modified documentation to reflect updated usage of osf and osfI.

Changes in version 1.041
Corrected definitions of \useosf and \useosfI.

Changes in version 1.04
Substantial reworking of kerning tables in small caps.
Substantial revision of italic and bold italic oldstyle figures.
Revised method for making support files with alternate form of oldstyle `one'.

Changes in version 1.03
Minor changes to kerning tables in small caps.
Changes to sty file to allow osf deferred until EndPreamble so that math always uses TLF.

Changes in version 1.02
Corrected the code so that there no longer an unwanted space following the footnote marker.

Changes in version 1.01
The method of generating the support files has changed from version 1.00, and is outlined below. The result is that the problem in version 1.00, where under the option oldstyle (or the macro \useosf) the resulting oldstyle 1 (like a short 1) failed to behave as the character 1 when copied from a pdf file, is now rectified.

The otf fonts contain all the kerning and other tables. Should you wish to modify these yourself, the following outline of the method should be followed. 

Place the 4 otf files and the 4 afm files in a new folder along with a subfolder named texmf. Then run the command

/usr/texbin/autoinst  --noupdmap  --noswash --notitling --noornaments --target=./texmf --encoding=TS1,T1,LY1 --vendor=public --typeface=xcharter *.otf

after cding to the new folder. You should replace the newly generated XCharter.sty and .fd files the with the ones from the distribution in order to preserve the functionality of the package. The names of the encoding files should also be modified appropriately from those assigned by autoinst. I used the following bash shell script, which assumed you are in the directory holding the otf files and a texmf subfolder:

#!/bin/bash
pushd texmf/fonts/map/dvips/xcharter
sed -i '' 's/<\[a_/<\[xch_/g' XCharter.map
popd
pushd texmf/fonts/enc/dvips/xcharter
for f in *.enc; do mv ${f} xch${f:1}; done
popd

To make the alternate form of osf `one' available, run the python script altone.py.
