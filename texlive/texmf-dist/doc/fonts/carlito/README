This is the README for the carlito package, version
2014-08-20.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the Carlito family of sans serif fonts, designed
by Lukasz Dziedzic of the tyPoland foundry and adopted by
Google for ChromeOS as a font-metric compatible replacement
for Calibri.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/carlito.tds.zip, where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirror.ctan.org.
Unzip the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree,
likely a personal or local tree. If necessary, update the
file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the font-map
files by enabling the Map file carlito.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{carlito}

to the preamble of your document. This makes Carlito the
default sans family. To also set Carlito as the main text
font, use

\usepackage[sfdefault]{carlito}

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to adjust
fontsizes to match a serifed font.

Slanted variants are not supported; the designed italic
variants will be automatically substituted. Font encodings
supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

Other options include

osf, oldstyle           Old Style figures
lf, lining              Lining figures
p, proportional         Proportional figures
t, tabular              Tabular (monospaced) figures

Commands \carlitoOsF, \carlitoLF, \carlitoTLF, \carlitoTOsF,
\sufigures (or \textsu{...}), and \infigures (or
\textin{...}) are available for localized use of non-default
figures.

The original truetype fonts are from

http://gsdview.appspot.com/chromeos-localmirror/distfiles/crosextrafonts-carlito-20130920.tar.gz 

and are licensed under the SIL Open Font License, (version
1.1); the text may be found in the doc directory. Fontforge
was used to convert the fonts to opentype CFF format. The
support files were created using autoinst and are licensed
under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public License.
The maintainer of this package is Bob Tennent (rdt at
cs.queensu.ca).
