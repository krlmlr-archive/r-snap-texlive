This is the French Cursive font, a cursive hand-writing font family in the
style of the French academic running-hand, written with Metafont.

This package is dated November 9, 2011.


Installation
------------

To install frcursive, you need to copy the files in appropriate places so that
TeX and Metafont can find them.

Installation by hand goes like this, assuming TEXMF is the base directory of
you TeX installation (that would be /usr/share/texmf, C:\localtexmf, or
something like that):
- copy the files from the "latex" directory into TEXMF/tex/latex/frcursive/
- copy the files from the "mf" directory into TEXMF/fonts/source/public/frcursive/
To use the Adobe Type 1 versions,
- copy the files from the "type1" directory into TEXMF/fonts/type1/public/frcursive/
- copy the files from the "tfm" directory into TEXMF/fonts/tfm/public/frcursive/
- copy "frcursive.map" into TEXMF/fonts/map/dvips/frcursive/
- make sure the TEXMF/web2c/updmap.cfg contains the line
  MixedMap frcursive.map
You may have to update TeX's databases by running "texhash" or "mktexlsr".


Usage
-----

The file "frcursive.pdf" contains the documentation of the LaTeX package.
