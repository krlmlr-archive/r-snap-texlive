\begin{verse}
\slshape
I heard this story \irish{o/ mo athair}\\
(If you haven't Gaelic, it doesn't matter).\\
This rural Irish tragic tale\\
Narrates a sad seductive \irish{sce/al}\\
Concerning lust without discretion\\
\irish{Agus beagnach rudai/ eile freisin}.

\irish{Uair amha/in -- fado/, fado/ --},\\
On a little farm near Carraroe\\
\upshape
Lived \irish{buachaill maith} named \irish{Mi/chea/l mo/r},\\
An only son of thirty-four.\\
When work was done at end of day,\\
He'd settle down with \irish{cupa/n tae}\\
And seldom felt the call to stroll\\
Or spend the evening time \irish{ag o/l}.\\
His intellectual needs were drawn\\
From books like \irish{\slshape Peig} and \irish{\slshape Iosaga/n}.

\itshape
And so it was \irish{bliain} in, \irish{bliain} out.\\
Our \irish{Mi/chea/l} hadn't moved about.\\
He dreamt of \irish{caili/n}s -- most men do --\\
But never sinned, \irish{an dtuigeann tu/?}

Meanwhile -- up in \irish{A/tha Cliath} --\\
A \irish{caili/n deas} had a bright idea:\\
When \irish{laethanta saoire} time came by,\\
Decided she would like to try\\
\scshape
\irish{A/it beag, ciu/in}, like Carraroe,\\
No foreign food -- not far to go --\\
And there to meet the native clan\\
Agus \irish{b'fhe/idir} find herself a man.

This \irish{caili/n deas} with eyes so blue\\
Was known in town as City Sue.\\
The lusty \irish{buachailli/} came crawling\\
And all agreed she was \irish{go h-a/lainn}.\\
\slshape
She left her men in state of shock.\\
Oh, \irish{Mi/chea/l Mo/r -- bi/ cu/ramach!}

This scarlet woman knows each trick.\\
She's heading west -- beware, \irish{a mhic}!\\
The lights shone in the Parish Hall\\
For the local \irish{Fa/inne}-wearers Ball.\\
\irish{Bhi/ Mi/chea/l ann \dots. Bhi/} Susie \irish{ann} \dots,\\
Dressed in a most seductive gown.

\upshape
Our brave \irish{Cu/ Chulainn} of the West,\\
His hurling medals across his chest,\\
Exclaimed, when City Sue came in:\\
"\irish{In ainm De/!}\ -- well \irish{fe/ach ar sin!}"\\
Though nervous -- still -- he took a chance:\\
"\irish{Ce/ad mi/le fa/ilte} -- will you dance?"\\
\irish{Go luath}, on the floor they strut\\
Cheek to cheek -- from mouth to foot.\\
\itshape
She whispered into \irish{Mi/chea/l}'s ear:\\
"\irish{E/ist liom} now, let's disappear,\\
We'll use my place, -- the door's unlocked,\\
You'll stay the night -- \irish{Seomra a hocht}".

\irish{Chri/ost! Mi/chea/l}'s \irish{ceann} was in a spin,\\
\irish{Ni/ raibh se/} thinking thoughts \irish{mar sin}!\\
He blessed himself -- this Jezebel\\
Would surely damn his soul to Hell.\\
\scshape
He stood aghast -- could hardly stutter,\\
So off he bolted -- \irish{ar a rothar}\\
And straight \irish{abhaile} -- into bed,\\
Decades of the rosary said.

\irish{Mi/chea/l Mo/r} still sleeps alone\\
In his \irish{leaba bheag -- ocho/n, ocho/n!}\\
He often dreams of \irish{Seomra a hocht} \dots.\\
What might have been, oh, \irish{Mi/chea/l bocht}!
