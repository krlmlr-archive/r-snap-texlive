-----------------------------------------------------
In both lower and upper case 32 letters are defined (18 `plain' ones,
5 long vowels and 9 aspirated consonants).  The ligature `agus' is
also made available.  The remaining characters (digits, punctuation
and accents) are inherited from the Computer Modern family of founts.

Within TeX the accented Irish letters are accessible as ligatures, in
a manner consistent with the usage on Gaelic-L.  A vowel followed by
a slash yields a long vowel; a lowercase consonant followed by  h,
or an uppercase consonant followed by either  H  or  h, yields an
aspirated consonant.  (The latter only works with those consonants
which actually undergo aspiration; for such things as  n  with a dot
above, as found in some old texts, the standard TeXnique -- in this
case  \.n  preceded by  \def\.#1{\accent26#1} -- must be used.)
The ligature `agus' is accessed as  7`  (seven-backquote).

Most fount files consult the files from the Sauter distribution
for parameters, so you have to download and install them before
you can generate the founts.  Sauter is available from CTAN.

Note that the *.fd files sometimes mention founts which are not
in the distribution.  Making at least some of those should be a
fairly straightforward task, but feel free to contact me for
assistance if you need it.
