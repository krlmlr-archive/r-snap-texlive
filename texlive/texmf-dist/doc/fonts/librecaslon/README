This is the README for the librecaslon package, version 2013-10-15.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX support for
the Libre Caslon family of fonts, designed by Pablo Impallari.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system download the file
tex-archive/install/fonts/librecaslon.tds.zip and unzip at the
root of an appropriate texmf tree, likely a personal or local tree. If
necessary, update the file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the
font-map files by enabling the Map file LibreCaslon.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{librecaslon}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate Libre Caslon
Text as the main (serifed) text font. A bold italic variant of Libre
Caslon is not currently available; as a stopgap, an artificially
slanted version has been generated and treated as if it were italic.

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish to
avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the
fonts.

The default figure style is lining but option osf (or oldstyle)
allows for use of oldstyle figures.

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

Macro \librecaslon selects the Libre Caslon Text family. Macros
\librecaslonLF and \librecaslonOsF allow for local use of lining
or oldstyle figures. \textsu{...} can be used for superior
(superscript) figures. Command \useosf switches the default figure
style to old-style figures; this is primarily for use after calling
a math package with lining figures as the default.

The original fonts (version 1.0) were obtained from

http://www.impallari.com/projects/overview/libre-caslon-display-and-text 

and are licensed under the SIL Open Font License (version 1.1);
the text may be found in the doc directory. The opentype and type1
versions were created using fontforge. The support files were
created using autoinst and are licensed under the terms of the
LaTeX Project Public License. The maintainer of this package is Bob
Tennent (rdt at cs.queensu.ca)
