This small package provides a means of accessing all features (plus scaling) of an extension of the txfont typewriter fonts as a typewriter font family to accompany any other chosen font packages. These are serifed typewriter faces that are taller and heavier than Latin Modern Typewriter and much heavier than Courier.


Current version: 1.03

Changes in version 1.03
Corrected an error in t1newtxttz.fd, thanks to J-F Burnol.

Changes in version 1.02
1. Corrected an error in newtxtt.sty. \let\ttdefault\ttsdefault->\let\ttdefault\ttzdefault
2. Added missing newtxttz*.tfm files. (Thanks to J-F Burnol who spotted these two issues.)
3. Fixed an error in ts1newtxttz.fd, line 28.

Changes in version 1.01
Added variant versions of the tfm files which are not monospaced though they share the same glyphs and glyph widths. The variant version permits hyphenation and has spacing more like a text font, so that it can be used to achieve right-justified blocks of text with a typewritten appearance. See the documentation for details.
