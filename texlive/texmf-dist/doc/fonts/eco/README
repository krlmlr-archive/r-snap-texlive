eco fonts v1.3 -- README
========================

This is a set of font metric files and virtual fonts for using the ec fonts
with oldstyle numerals. This font family is called eco fonts. (No pun
intended.)

It can only be used together with the standard ec fonts. (European Computer
Modern fonts by J"org Knappen <knappen@vkpmzd.kph.uni-mainz.de>,
CTAN:/fonts/ec)

It consists of:
 - .tfm files for use by TeX in new Cork encoding
 - .vf (virtual font) files for dvi drivers
 - .fd (font definition) files for use with LaTeX2e
 - eco.sty style file which loads the T1 encoding and sets the family defaults
   for eco fonts. 
 - create.sh (Bourne shell script) which reproduces the whole font family. 
   *DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT* if you don't know exactly what you're doing! It 
   is only provided as a sample of how to produce such a font family and it
   *NOT* needed for normal operation.

The .tfm files of the eco fonts were produced using the original .tfm files of
the ec fonts from CTAN.

eco.sty is sufficient to use the eco fonts, but if you intend to use other
font families as well, eg. PostScript fonts, I recommend that you try the
altfont package, from CTAN:/macros/latex/contrib/supported/altfont.

Because some of the filenames have more than 8 characters, I am afraid that
the package is unusable with MS-DOG.
