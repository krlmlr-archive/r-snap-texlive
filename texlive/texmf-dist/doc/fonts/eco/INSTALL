eco fonts v1.3 -- INSTALL
=========================

The eco fonts have to be installed in addition to the ec fonts by J"org
Knappen <knappen@vkpmzd.kph.uni-mainz.de>. You can get the ec fonts from
CTAN:/fonts/ec.

All the files ending in .sty, .tfm, .vf and .fd have to installed where TeX
and/or your dvi driver can find them. Please refer to your TeX distribution's
manual for how to install additional packages.

According to the TeX Directory Standard (TDS), the files should be installed
in your local texmf/ tree as follows:

-- src/eco.sty -> texmf/tex/latex/eco/
-- tfm/* -> texmf/fonts/tfm/public/eco/
-- vf/* -> texmf/fonts/vf/public/eco/
-- fd/* -> texmf/tex/latex/eco/


To use the eco fonts in your documents, load eco.sty by including the
following:

	\usepackage{eco}

eco.sty provides the additional command \newstylenums{} (analogous to
\oldstylenums{}) which switches back to new-style figures.
