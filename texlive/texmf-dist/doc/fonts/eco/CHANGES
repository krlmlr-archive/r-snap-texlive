eco fonts v1.3 -- CHANGES
=========================

v1.1 (1998/06/04): 
-	Fixed a fairly nasty spacing error: 
	fontinst doesn't use the \fontdimens from the .pl files it reads in,
	but uses its own standard values instead; this can lead to inferior
	typesetting quality in some cases. 
	dostretch.mtx fixes this problem.
	Thanks to Rowland <rebecca@astrid.u-net.com> for spotting this 
	problem and to Alan Jeffrey <ajeffrey@cs.depaul.edu> for providing 
	a fix.
v1.2 (1998/07/19):
-	Added INSTALL. Funny, I never really thought of writing an 
	installation guide. 
-	New command \newstylenums{} in eco.sty (analogous to \oldstylenums{}.)
v1.3 (1999/06/4):
-	I became a victim of copy&paste: The file T1cmoss.fd contained
	substitution rules for cmor, which substituted cmor/m/sl for
	cmor/m/it once T1cmoss.fd was loaded. This is one of those
	errors that simply shout out "Hit me, I'm stupid!". 
-	\newstylenums{} works now. (Nobody ever noticed this, so apparently 
	nobody ever used this command, not even the person who requested it.)
-	Fixed some bugs concerning logging in create.sh.
