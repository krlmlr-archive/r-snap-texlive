Genealogy symbols in METAFONT
-----------------------------

Files in this distribution:

  drgen10.mf  % the mf driver file
  drgen10.tfm % tfm file for TeX
  drgen.mf    % the mf character definitions
  testgen.tex % a test file
  README      % this file
  licence.txt % licence conditions

The MF files in this distribution are a simple compilation 
of the genealogical symbols found in the `wasy' and `gen' font. 
Actually, all I have done was to add the male and female symbols 
to Knuth's `gen' font. Thus, it avoids loading two fonts 
when you need only genealogical symbols.

Hope this is helpful to somebody.
