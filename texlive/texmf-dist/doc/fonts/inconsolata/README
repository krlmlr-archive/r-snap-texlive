The PostScript fonts in this distribution were derived from Inconsolata-Regular.ttf, v.1.013, and Inconsolata-Bold.ttf, v.1.014, downloaded from googlefonts.com. Both were converted to PostScript format and nine glyphs were added to each, providing upright single and double quotes, a more shapely lower-case l series, and horizontal arrows. As Inconsolata-Regular.ttf is offered under the SIL font licence, so is the derived font Inconsolatazi4-Regular.pfb. Inconsolata-Bold.ttf was released under the Apache 2 licence, and so therefore is the derived font Inconsolatazi4-Bold.pfb.

Version: 1.05

Changes in version 1.05
(1) Modifications to all fd files to remove error that became visible only when used without the sty file.
(2) Added a brief .fontspec file so that, when using the fonts with fontspec, you can write
\fontspec{inconsolata}
to load the basic fontnames.

Changes in version 1.04
Modified all fonts so that glyph names of the variant forms permit correct copying from pdf to ASCII.

Changes in version 1.03
(1) Added ss01, ss02 and ss03 tables to the otf versions, providing options for glyph variants under fontspec.
(2) Corrections to some of the fd files affecting bold weight. 

Changes in version 1.02
(1) The otf versions of the fonts were modified so their names and properties are better-behaved than the original ones. (Thanks to Greg' Ar Tourter for very useful feedback.) 

Changes in version 1.01
(1) Added the ts1 tfms and fd that were inadvertently omitted from version 1.0.
(2) Added inconsolata.sty to doc/fonts/inconsolata. It is essentially a copy of zi4.sty, and should be copied to your personal texmf tree if you wish to retain the old name.
(3) Added the otf versions of the fonts to the distribution.

Installation:

Mac OS X: To install, open a Terminal window and cd to inside the downloaded TDS folder.

Method A (recommended): type

sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/web2c
sudo cp -Rfp * /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
sudo echo Map zi4.map >> /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/web2c/updmap.cfg
sudo mktexlsr
sudo -H updmap-sys

Method B: If you insist on making your font installations in your home folder, potentially making your personal installation become out of sync with updates to TeXLive, use instead

(i) if you checked Update for All Users in TeXLive utility

cp -Rfp * ~/Library/texmf

then

updmap --enable Map=zi4.map

(ii) otherwise

cp -Rfp * ~/Library/texmf

then

sudo updmap-sys --enable Map=zi4.map

Linux: Very similar to Mac OS X.

MikTeX: Copy the Inconsolata-zi4.tds.zip to the root of the folder you use for personal additions to the TeX trees, open a command window, chdir to that folder, and type

unzip Inconsolata-zi4.tds
initexmf --update-fndb
initexmf --edit-config-file updmap

The latter command should open updmap.cfg in your default editor, commonly Notepad. Add the line 

Map zi4.map 

to updmap.cfg, save and close. Then, in the command window, type

initexmf --mkmaps

You can ignore error messages that may occur here. This should result in a properly enabled garamondx.
