The Documentation directory is now split into two halves, one each for
users of current LaTeX (subdirectory 2e) and of LaTeX 2.09
(subdirectory 209).  Each directory contains macro files appropriate
for use with `its' version of LaTeX, as well as a copy of the
documentation.

The support for current LaTeX is not regarded as final: indeed, it has
some `rough' features.  However, it does work as required, and is
supplied to meet users' needs.
