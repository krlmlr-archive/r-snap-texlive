The staves package has been designed to provide an interface to the icelandic
font, designed by the author of this package. The font contains all ``magical'' 
staves presented on the Web site of the Icelandic Museum of Sorcery and Witchcraft. 
In addition, the package provides a simple command to typeset Icelandic runes.
