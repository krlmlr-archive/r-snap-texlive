These are the Belleek fonts described in my paper at TUG 98, the 1998 annual
meeting of the TeX Users Group.  They are drop-in replacements for the
proprietary fonts required by the LaTeX mathtime style, where the "dropping
in" process is simply to change the .fd files calling for specific fonts to
reflect the font names starting with "bl".

Notwithstanding any copyright notices in the files, these fonts have been
contributed to the public domain in their Type 1 (.pfb) and TrueType (.ttf)
forms:

    blex
    blsy
    rblmi
