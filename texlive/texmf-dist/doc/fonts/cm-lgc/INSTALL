========================================================================

These are generic installation instructions for the CM-LGC font package.

Below, we assume that your TeX system is compliant to the TDS (TeX
Directory Structure) standard. If it is not so, refer to documentation of
your TeX system for the proper locations of files of various types.

To install the CM-LGC font package in teTeX, fpTeX, TeX Live, MikTeX 
or VTeX/Free systems:

1. Copy everything in package's fonts/ directory to the directory of the
same name inside one of your TEXMF trees (e. g. /usr/share/texmf/fonts/ or
C:\texmf\fonts\).  Thus all *.pfb, *.afm, *.tfm, *.vf, *.ofm and *.ovf
files will be copied  to the appropriate subdirectories where they should
reside.

2. Again, copy everything in tex/ and (optionally) omega/  directories to
the directories of the same name inside a TEXMF tree in order to make all
*.fd files and style packages available to LaTeX and Omega/Lambda.

3. (a) [not for VTeX/Free] Repeat the step above also for package's
   dvips/ directory.

   (b) [for VTeX/Free only] For VTeX special font mapping files are
   required, which are not compatible with those used by dvips.
   Previously, these files resided in texmf/vtex/, but the directory
   structure has been changed in recent VTeX/Free versions (I have tested
   CM-LGC 0.5 with VTeX/Free 8.44), so that now all files responsible for
   font mapping should be placed into the common texmf/fonts/ directory
   instead. This is very inconvenient, because now you can't copy
   everyting in vtex/ to your texmf/vtex/ directory, as it is performed
   for all other files. On the other hand, I can't put my VTeX-specific
   stuff to the main fonts/ directory of the package, since this directory
   should contain only files needed for *all* TeX distributions. 

   So beginning from v. 0.5 the vtex/ directory of the CM-LGC package
   contains one subdirectory, called fonts/. You should copy everything
   found in this subdirectory (basically, *.ali and *.enc files) to the
   texmf/fonts/ directory of your VTeX installation rather than to
   texmf/vtex.

5. Instruct your TeX (pdftex, vtex, etc.) or drivers (dvips, dvipdfm,
etc.) to use your new fonts. To accomplish this, do one of the following
points which corresponds to your TeX system (if it is not listed here,
please refer to the documentation).

(a) [for teTeX or fpTeX] Edit the file web2c/updmap.cfg inside your
    $VARTEXMF tree (or your main $TEXMF tree) and add  the following line:

    Map cm-lgc.map

    Then run the `updmap' script to update font mapping files for
    dvips, pdfTeX and dvipdfm.

(b) [for MikTeX] Edit the file updmap.cfg which resides inside your local 
    TeX tree, e. g. C:\localtexmf\miktex\config\updmap.cfg (you
    should first create this file if it doesn't exist) and add the
    same line as for teTeX or fpTeX, i. e.:

    Map cm-lgc.map

(c) [for VTeX/Free only] Edit the files .../texmf/vtex/config/ps.fm
    and .../texmf/vtex/config/pdf.fm, and add the following line into the 
    TYPE1 section:

    cm-lgc.ali
    
    Optionally you may also add the cm-lgc-vf.ali file to the VF3 section
    of your pdf.fm file (create this section, if it doesn't exist).
    According to the VTeX documentation, adding a special mapping file for
    virtual fonts should enable searching in pdf files generated by VTeX,
    as well as copying text (including non-ASCII characters) into another
    applications. However, using this file really seems to have no effect,
    at least in VTeX/Free v. 8.44. 

6. [not for VTeX/Free] Update the filename search database: run "mktexlsr"
on teTeX, TeX Live, or fpTeX; run "initexmf -u" on MikTeX (or go to
"MikTeX Options" -> "General" -> "File name database" and do the same by
pressing the "Refresh now" button).

7. [not for VTeX/Free] update font mapping files for dvips, pdfTeX and
dvipdfm: run the "updmap" script on teTeX, TeX Live, or fpTeX; run
"initexmf --mkmaps" on MikTeX.

8. You can install the CM-LGC fonts as regular Windows fonts, if you
wish to use them in non-TeX applications (e.g. packages for preparation 
of graphics which are to be included into your TeX documents, or even 
word processors, etc.)

If you use Windows 9*/Me or Windows NT 4.0, you will need Adobe Type
Manager (either a regular version, or the Lite version, which is available
for free from the Adobe web site).

Place all corresponding PFB, AFM, and INF files which you need to
install into the same directory, and feed it to ATM (or to the standard
Windows font installation utility under Windows 2000/XP).
