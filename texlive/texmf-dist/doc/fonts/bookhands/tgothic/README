    The tgothic and alltgoth packages provide Metafont fonts based on the 
Gothic Textura Quadrata manuscript book-hand used between the 13th & 15th century AD. 
The font consists of minuscules and digits, with some appropriate 
period punctuation marks. Both normal and bold versions are provided. 
This is one in a series of manuscript fonts.

    Access to the docmfp package is desireable but not essential.

    The distribution consists of the following files:
README (this file)
tgothic.ins
tgothic.dtx
tryfont.tex
allfont.tex

    The distribution is provided under the terms of the LaTeX
Project Public License (LPPL).

To install the package:
=======================

o run: latex tgothic.ins, which will generate:
       tgoth*.mf files
       *.fd files
       tgothic.sty
       alltgoth.sty
o Move the generated files to locations where LaTeX will find them.
    For example: the tgoth*.mf files to .../texmf/fonts/source/public/tgothic
                 the *.fd and *.sty files to /texmf/tex/latex/local/tgothic

    On a teTeX distribution you might also have to add lines like the 
    following to texmf/fontname/special.map:
      tgoth7.mf        public    tgothic
      tgoth10.mf       public    tgothic
      tgoth17.mf       public    tgothic
      tgothb7.mf       public    tgothic
      tgothb10.mf      public    tgothic
      tgothb17.mf      public    tgothic
    On a teTeX distribution remember to run texhash after moving the files.

    (I use a teTeX distribution and found that if I didn't add to the special.map
     file, then the generated tfm and pk files were put in directories corresponding
     to some vendor's font.) 

    Other LaTeX distributions might require procedures similar to those for teTeX.

To typeset the documentation:
=============================

o run: latex tgothic.dtx
o if you want an index then run: makeindex -s gind.ist tgothic
o run: latex tgothic.dtx
o Print tgothic.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual 

    Note that the docmfp package is normally required for LaTeXing tgothic.dtx.
The package is available from CTAN in tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported.
If you haven't got this and don't want to get it, then there are instructions
in the first part of the .dtx file about how to edit it to avoid the use of docmfp.
(docmfp is an extension of the doc package for describing METAFONT, or other
non-LaTeX, code.)


To check out your installation:
===============================

o run: latex tryfont  for a testpage of the fonts
o run: latex allfont  for a document typeset with the fonts
