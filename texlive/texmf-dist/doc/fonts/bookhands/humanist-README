    The humanist and allhmin packages provide Metafont fonts based on the 
Humanist manuscript book-hand used from the 14th century AD onwards. 
The font consists of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, 
and with some appropriate period punctuation marks. Both normal and bold 
versions are provided. 
This is one in a series of manuscript fonts.

    Access to the docmfp package is desireable but not essential.

  This work has the LPPL maintenance status "author-maintained".
 
  This work consists of the files README, humanist.dtx, humanist.ins,
  tryfont.tex, and allfont.tex and the derived files humanist.sty,
  allhmin.sty, ot1hmin.fd, t1hmin.fd, hmin7.mf, hmin10.mf, hmin17.mf,
  hminb7.mf, hminb10.mf, hminb17.mf, hmindig.mf, hminl.mf, hminlig.mf,
  hminpunct.mf, hmintitle.mf and hminu.mf.
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 

    The distribution consists of the following files:
README (this file)
humanist.ins
humanist.dtx
tryfont.tex
allfont.tex


To install the package:
=======================

o run: latex humanist.ins, which will generate:
       hmin*.mf files
       *.fd files
       humanist.sty
       allhmin.sty
o Move the generated files to locations where LaTeX will find them.
    For example: the hmin*.mf files to .../texmf/fonts/source/public/humanist
                 the *.fd and *.sty files to /texmf/tex/latex/local/humanist

    On a teTeX distribution you might also have to add lines like the 
    following to texmf/fontname/special.map:
      hmin7.mf        public    humanist
      hmin10.mf       public    humanist
      hmin17.mf       public    humanist
      hminb7.mf       public    humanist
      hminb10.mf      public    humanist
      hminb17.mf      public    humanist
    On a teTeX distribution remember to run texhash after moving the files.

    (I use a teTeX distribution and found that if I didn't add to the special.map
     file, then the generated tfm and pk files were put in directories corresponding
     to some vendor's font.) 

    Other LaTeX distributions might require procedures similar to those for teTeX.

o If you are reinstalling the font, you should first delete any existing 
  generated tfm and pk files for the font, then follow the above procedure.

To typeset the documentation:
=============================

o run: latex humanist.dtx
o if you want an index then run: makeindex -s gind.ist humanist
o run: latex humanist.dtx
o Print humanist.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual 

    Note that the docmfp package is normally required for LaTeXing humanist.dtx.
The package is available from CTAN in tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported.
If you haven't got this and don't want to get it, then there are instructions
in the first part of the .dtx file about how to edit it to avoid the use of docmfp.
(docmfp is an extension of the doc package for describing METAFONT, or other
non-LaTeX, code.)


To check out your installation:
===============================

o run: latex tryfont  for a testpage of the fonts
o run: latex allfont  for a document typeset with the fonts
