    The inslrmin and allimin packages provide Metafont fonts based on the 
Insular Miniscules manuscript book-hand used from the 6th century onwards. 
The font consists of minuscules and digits, with some appropriate 
period punctuation marks. Both normal and bold versions are provided. 
This is one in a series of manuscript fonts.

    Access to the docmfp package is desireable but not essential.

    The distribution consists of the following files:
README (this file)
inslrmin.ins
inslrmin.dtx
tryfont.tex
allfont.tex

    The distribution is provided under the terms of the LaTeX
Project Public License (LPPL).

To install the package:
=======================

o run: latex inslrmin.ins, which will generate:
       imin*.mf files
       *.fd files
       inslrmin.sty
       allimin.sty
o Move the generated files to locations where LaTeX will find them.
    For example: the imin*.mf files to .../texmf/fonts/source/public/inslrmin
                 the *.fd and *.sty files to /texmf/tex/latex/local/inslrmin

    On a teTeX distribution you might also have to add lines like the 
    following to texmf/fontname/special.map:
      imin7.mf        public    inslrmin
      imin10.mf       public    inslrmin
      imin17.mf       public    inslrmin
      iminb7.mf       public    inslrmin
      iminb10.mf      public    inslrmin
      iminb17.mf      public    inslrmin
    On a teTeX distribution remember to run texhash after moving the files.

    (I use a teTeX distribution and found that if I didn't add to the special.map
     file, then the generated tfm and pk files were put in directories corresponding
     to some vendor's font.) 

    Other LaTeX distributions might require procedures similar to those for teTeX.

To typeset the documentation:
=============================

o run: latex inslrmin.dtx
o if you want an index then run: makeindex -s gind.ist inslrmin
o run: latex inslrmin.dtx
o Print inslrmin.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual 

    Note that the docmfp package is normally required for LaTeXing inslrmin.dtx.
The package is available from CTAN in tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported.
If you haven't got this and don't want to get it, then there are instructions
in the first part of the .dtx file about how to edit it to avoid the use of docmfp.
(docmfp is an extension of the doc package for describing METAFONT, or other
non-LaTeX, code.)


To check out your installation:
===============================

o run: latex tryfont  for a testpage of the fonts
o run: latex allfont  for a document typeset with the fonts
