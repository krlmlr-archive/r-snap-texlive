    The carolmin and allcmin packages provide Metafont fonts based on the 
Carolingan Miniscules manuscript book-hand used between the 8th & 12th century AD. 
The font consists of minuscules and digits, with some appropriate 
period punctuation marks. Both normal and bold versions are provided. 
This is one in a series of manuscript fonts.

    Access to the docmfp package is desireable but not essential.

    The distribution consists of the following files:
README (this file)
carolmin.ins
carolmin.dtx
tryfont.tex
allfont.tex

    The distribution is provided under the terms of the LaTeX
Project Public License (LPPL).

To install the package:
=======================

o run: latex carolmin.ins, which will generate:
       cmin*.mf files
       *.fd files
       carolmin.sty
       allcmin.sty
o Move the generated files to locations where LaTeX will find them.
    For example: the cmin*.mf files to .../texmf/fonts/source/public/carolmin
                 the *.fd and *.sty files to /texmf/tex/latex/local/carolmin

    On a teTeX distribution you might also have to add lines like the 
    following to texmf/fontname/special.map:
      cmin7.mf        public    carolmin
      cmin10.mf       public    carolmin
      cmin17.mf       public    carolmin
      cminb7.mf       public    carolmin
      cminb10.mf      public    carolmin
      cminb17.mf      public    carolmin
    On a teTeX distribution remember to run texhash after moving the files.

    (I use a teTeX distribution and found that if I didn't add to the special.map
     file, then the generated tfm and pk files were put in directories corresponding
     to some vendor's font.) 

    Other LaTeX distributions might require procedures similar to those for teTeX.

To typeset the documentation:
=============================

o run: latex carolmin.dtx
o if you want an index then run: makeindex -s gind.ist carolmin
o run: latex carolmin.dtx
o Print carolmin.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual 

    Note that the docmfp package is normally required for LaTeXing carolmin.dtx.
The package is available from CTAN in tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported.
If you haven't got this and don't want to get it, then there are instructions
in the first part of the .dtx file about how to edit it to avoid the use of docmfp.
(docmfp is an extension of the doc package for describing METAFONT, or other
non-LaTeX, code.)


To check out your installation:
===============================

o run: latex tryfont  for a testpage of the fonts
o run: latex allfont  for a document typeset with the fonts
