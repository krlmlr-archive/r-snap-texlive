    The rustic and allrust packages provide fonts based on the 
Roman Rustic manuscript book-hand used between the 1st and 6th 
century AD. The font consists of majuscules only, with some 
appropriate period punctuation marks. Both normal and bold versions 
are provided. This is one in a series of manuscript fonts.

    Access to the docmfp package is desireable but not essential.

    The distribution consists of the following files:
README (this file)
rustic.ins
rustic.dtx
tryfont.tex
allfont.tex

    The distribution is provided under the terms of the LaTeX
Project Public License (LPPL).

To install the package:
=======================

o run: latex rustic.ins, which will generate:
       rust*.mf files
       *.fd files
       rustic.sty
       allrust.sty
o Move the generated files to locations where LaTeX will find them.
    For example: the rust*.mf files to .../texmf/fonts/source/public/rustic
                 the *.fd and .sty files to /texmf/tex/latex/local/rustic

    On a teTeX distribution you might also have to add lines like the 
    following to texmf/fontname/special.map:
      rust7.mf        public    rustic
      rust10.mf       public    rustic
      rust17.mf       public    rustic
      rustb7.mf       public    rustic
      rustb10.mf      public    rustic
      rustb17.mf      public    rustic
    On a teTeX distribution remember to run texhash after moving the files.

    (I use a teTeX distribution and found that if I didn't add to the special.map
     file, then the generated tfm and pk files were put in directories corresponding
     to another set of fonts according to the font naming scheme for vendors' 
     fonts.) 

    Other LaTeX distributions might require procedures similar to those for teTeX.

To typeset the documentation:
=============================

o run: latex rustic.dtx
o if you want an index then run: makeindex -s gind.ist rustic
o run: latex rustic.dtx
o Print rustic.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual 

    Note that the docmfp package is normally required for LaTeXing rustic.dtx.
The package is available from CTAN in tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported.
If you haven't got this and don't want to get it, then there are instructions
in the first part of the .dtx file about how to edit it to avoid the use of docmfp.
(docmfp is an extension of the doc package for describing METAFONT, or other
non-LaTeX, code.)


To check out your installation:
===============================

o run: latex tryfont  for samples of the Roman Rustic font
o run: latex allfont  for a sample document typeset with the Roman Rustic font
