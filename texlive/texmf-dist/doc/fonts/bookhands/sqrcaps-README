    The sqrcaps bundle provides packages and fonts for a script based on
the Square Capitals manuscript bookhand used from the 1st century AD.
The script consists of capital letters and digits, with some appropriate
period punctuation marks; both normal and bold versions are supplied.
The bundle is one of a series for bookhand scripts.

README (this file)

    To install the package:
o run: latex sqrcaps.ins, which will generate:
       sqrcaps.sty
       *.fd files
       sqrcaps.map
o Move *.sty and *.fd files to a location where LaTeX will find them
    e.g., .../texmf-local/tex/latex/sqrcaps
o Move *.afm, *.pfb and *.tfm files to where LaTeX looks for font information
    e.g., .../texmf-var/fonts/afm/public/bookhands/*.afm
          .../texmf-var/fonts/type1/public/bookhands/*.pfb
          .../texmf-var/fonts/tfm/public/bookhands/*.tfm
o Add the *.map information to the dvips/pdftex font maps
o Refresh the database
 (for more information on the above see the FAQ).

o run: (pdf)latex trysqrcaps for a test of the font

    To generate a second copy of the manual (which is already supplied as a 
PDF file) access to the docmfp package is desireable but not essential:
o run: latex sqrcaps.dtx
o (for an index run: makeindex -s gind.ist *.idx)
o run: latex *.dtx
o Print *.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual
