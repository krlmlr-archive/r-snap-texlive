What's new?
===========
As with this version 1.0, a few bugs concerning the design
parameters have been fixed, and the fonts match their OT1
and mathematical counterparts now.  Unfortunately this
resulted in changes to the font metrics.



Overview
========

`European Concrete' is an implementation of Donald
Knuth's Comcrete fonts, providing T1 text fonts and TS1
text companion fonts.

The subdirectory src contains the following METAFONT
sources:

conc??pt, coni10pt               common design parameters 
eorm5.mf       EC roman medium    5pt
eorm6.mf                          6pt
eorm7.mf                          7pt
eorm8.mf                          8pt
eorm9.mf                          9pt
eorm10.mf                        10pt
eosl9.mf       EC slanted         9pt
eosl10.mf                        10pt
eocc10.mf      EC small capitals 10pt
eoti10.mf      EC text italic    10pt
torm5.mf       TC roman medium    5pt
torm6.mf                          6pt
torm7.mf                          7pt
torm8.mf                          8pt
torm9.mf                          9pt
torm10.mf                        10pt
tosl9.mf       TC slanted         9pt      
tosl10.mf                        10pt
toti10.mf      TC italic         10pt 
tcssdc10.mf    TC Sans Serif demibold condensed 10pt

The naming scheme corresponds to J. Knappen's EC fonts:
  eo.. = textfont, T1 encoding
  to.. = text companion font, TS1 encoding

The subdirectory tfm contains tfm files for all fonts listed
above.

Further files:

readme          the file you are reading now
liesmich        the german version of `readme'



Installing the fonts
====================

The files from the subdirectory `src' must be moved to a
directory where METAFONT searches for its input files.  The
files from the subdirectory `tfm' must be moved to a
directory where TeX/LaTeX searches for font metrics.  In
order to generate the bitmap fonts, METAFONT sources of the
EC fonts, version 1.0 or later, are also required.

Note:
The Concrete fonts are lacking a bold variant.  It is
recommended to use `CM sansserif demibold condensed'
(cmssdc10, ecssdc10) as a substitute.  The related text
companion font tcssdc10 is, however, not distributed as part
of EV 1.0.  That's why I have provided it here.



Known bugs and deficiencies
===========================

There are no T1/TS1 versions of the `grafitti' font ccslc9.



Future changes and additions
============================

The EC Concrete fonts will reflect all future changes and
additions to J. Knappen's EC(-Modern) distribution.
