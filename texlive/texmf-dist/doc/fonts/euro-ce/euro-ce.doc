           EURO CURRENCY SYMBOL and CE MARK -- DOCUMENTATION

                           *** SUMMARY ***

(1) METAFONT source of the official euro currency symbol and scores of
    variants, including italic, slanted, boldface, boldface italic
    boldface slanted, condensed, and outline.  Varying single parameters
    for compression, thickness, and slanting allows the user to add new
    variants.

(2) METAFONT source of the CE mark and several variants.

The METAFONT source files should be run with plain METAFONT.

Files should be renamed whenever they are modified!  This in particular
concerns the files euroit.mf and alike, defining the constants C, S, and
T for compression, slanting, and thickness.


                          *** CHARACTERS ***

The euro symbol is provided in roman (eurorm.mf), italic (euroit.mf),
slanted (eurosl.mf), boldface (eurobf.mf), boldface italic (eurobfit.mf),
and boldface slanted (eurobfsl.mf) typefaces, each of which comprises the
letters:

  E,e     official width
  D,d     demicondensed
  F,f     condensed
  G,g     double condensed
  O,o     one-pixel-outline, official width
  N,n     one-pixel-outline, demicondensed
  P,p     one-pixel-outline, condensed
  Q,q     one-pixel-outline, double condensed

Upper-case letters refer to euro symbols having the height of the
capital C of the corresponding Computer Modern roman font.  Lower-case
letters refer to euro symbols having the height of the Computer Modern
roman numerals (which you may like better).

The file euroof.mf contains only the official symbol.

The file eurosp.mf provides a number of "strange" euro symbols.

The CE mark is available in roman (cerm.mf), italic (ceit.mf), and
slanted (cesl.mf) typefaces:

  CE      CE mark
  ce      CE mark, one-pixel-outline


                     *** NOTES ON PROGRAMMING ***

The euro currency symbols are computed on the basis of the geometry
published on the European Union's web site www.europa.eu.int/euro.  The
official symbol, which is of roman type and inspired by the Greek letter
epsilon (rather than the capital C), is composed of a well-defined
280-degree segment of a perfect circle and two cross bars.  It features a
uniform thickness, 1/12 of its outer diameter, and distinctive oblique
ends.

With regard to the condensed (i.e., horizontally compressed), italic, and
slanted variants derived here from the official geometry, the following
observations are of relevance:

(i) Horizontal compression and slanting are straightforwardly implemented
by the use of METAFONT's transformations.  These transformations permit
control of compression and slanting through single parameters;

(ii) It is desirable that a uniform thickness be preserved.  In case the
official euro symbol has been drawn by filling its outline, however, this
requirement precludes constructing its variants by transformations.
Horizontal compression would narrow the upright strokes of the circle,
while slanting would make the first and third quadrants thicker, and the
second and fourth quadrants thinner;

(iii) By contrast, METAFONT's pen nibs are invariant under METAFONT's
transformations.

The symbols are therefore drawn by (a) picking up a circular pen of a
diameter equal to the chosen thickness, (b) drawing a full circle and
oversized cross bars, and (c) erasing the excess according to the demands
of the geometry.  Horizontal scaling and slanting transformations, to the
extent applicable, then provide the desired result.

Horizontal compression, slanting, and thickness are controlled by the
parameters C, S, and T, which are input to the generating macro
"draw_euro" in the driver file "euromac.mf".  Their default values
correspond to the official symbol, i.e., C=1 (no compression), S=0 (no
slanting), and T=1 (thickness is 1/12 of the outer diameter).  Possible
combinations are of course limited by the geometry.

The width of the box is taken equal to the overall width of the
compressed, but unslanted symbol at the given thickness, augmented with
uniform cmr10-sized margins at either side.  The italic corrections
provided are designed to maintain the right margin.

More technical details are commented on in the driver file "euromac.mf"
itself.  Running "eurosp.mf" in proof mode demonstrates the robustness of
"draw_euro" against variations of C, S, and T from their default values.

The above is of equal concern to the CE mark and, for that matter, any
other fully or partly circular image.


                       *** EXAMPLES OF USAGE ***
In TeX:

\font\euro=eurorm scaled \magstephalf       % 11-point roman euro symbol
\def\EUR{{\euro E}}
\EUR 123.00

\font\ce=cerm                               % 10-point CE symbol
{\ce CE}


In LaTeX:

\newfont{\euroit}{euroit scaled \magstep1}  % 12-point italic euro symbol
\newcommand{\EUR}{{\euroit E}}
\EUR 123.00

\newfont{\ce}{cerm}                         % 10-point CE symbol
{\ce CE}


                           *** HISTORY ***

v1.2 (2 June 1998)       eurorm, euroit, eurosl, cerm, ceit, cesl.

v1.3 (9 February 2001)   Adding the eurobf; modification of euromac.mf to
                         accommodate boldface euro symbols;  improved
                         handling of font dimensions;  minor corrections.

v1.3a (15 February 2002) Patch in euromac.mf to remove spurious speckles.

v2.0 (3 March 2002)      Adding demicondensed euro symbols (which seem
                         quite popular), eurobfit, and eurobfsl.

v3.0 (6 March 2002)      Completely revised package.  Improved METAFONT
                         code.  Improvements include better positioning
                         of euro symbol in box, better rendition at low
                         resolution, and adding eurosp.

v3.0b (6 March 2012)     Added permissions regarding usage and redistri-
                         bution to README and euro-ce.doc.  Other files
                         remained as in version 3.0.  Author's contact
                         data updated.
