Originally written 1990, Alan Hoenig.
This notice added by Clea F. Rees 2010/12/13 following correspondence between
Alan Hoenig and Karl Berry, who also suggested adding the included reference to
<http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb11-3/tb29hoenig.pdf> and renaming duerer.readme to
README. File list and references amended accordingly.

This directory contains the "Computer Duerer" fonts designed by Alan Hoenig (see
the 1990 TUG Conference Proceedings for a full background on this or Alan
Hoenig's article at <http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb11-3/tb29hoenig.pdf> for further
details). The version here is for use as titling only and consists of the
uppercase letters A-Z.
