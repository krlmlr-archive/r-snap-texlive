(La)TeX Support
---------------

For details, please see romandeadf.pdf.

The (La)TeX support requires nfssext-cfr and xkeyval. These packages are
available from CTAN.

The (La)TeX support should be considered somewhat experimental. If you find
any problems, please let me know and I will try to correct them. If you can
send a fix, so much the better.
