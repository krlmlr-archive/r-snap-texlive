This is the README for the alegreya package, version 2014-05-22.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX support
for the Alegreya and Alegreya Sans families of fonts, designed by
Juan Pablo del Peral (juan at huertatipografica.com.ar) for Huerta
Tipográfica (http://www.huertatipografica.com.ar).

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system download
the file "tex-archive"/install/fonts/alegreya.tds.zip where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirrors.ctan.org. Unzip
the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree, likely a
personal or local tree. If necessary, update the file-name database
(e.g., texhash). Update the font-map files by enabling the Map file
Alegreya.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{Alegreya}

and/or

\usepackage{AlegreyaSans}

to the preamble of your document. These will activate Alegreya as
the main (serifed) text font and/or Alegreya Sans as the sans-serif
font. To use the Sans font as the main text font, use

\usepackage[sfdefault]{AlegreyaSans}

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish
to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the
fonts.

The default figure style is proportional-lining, but the oldstyle
(or osf) option will change the default to OldStyle figures and
the tabular (or tf) option will change the default to tabular
(monospaced) figures. 

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

The black option to either package activates that series as the
default bold font. Options thin, light, medium, and extrabold are
similarly available but for the Sans family only.

Commands \Alegreya, \AlegreyaSC, \AlegreyaBlack, \AlegreyaSans,
\AlegreyaSansSC, \AlegreyaSansThin, \AlegreyaSansLight,
\AlegreyaSansMedium, \AlegreyaSansExtraBold, and \AlegreyaSansBlack
select the specified family.

Commands \AlegreyaLF, \AlegreyaOsF, \AlegreyaTLF, and \AlegreyaTOsF
allow for localized use of non-default figures. Superior or inferior
numbers are available using \sufigures, \infigures, \textsu{...} or
\textin{...}. Command \useosf switches the default figure style to
old-style figures; this is primarily for use after calling a math
package with lining figures as the default.
