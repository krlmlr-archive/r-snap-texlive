This package provides some LaTeX support for the use of EBGaramond12 in
mathematics.  It is based on, and requires, ebgaramond. It was created in
response to a question at http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/152038/ and tested in
the form of an answer at http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/152347/. It is
published as a package at the request of the question author in the hope that
it may be useful but scarcely the expectation.

To the best of the author's knowledge, no hedgehogs were harmed in the
production of this package.
