The files in this collection are virtual fonts and LaTeX support files based on the pxfonts and txfonts packages, providing script, fraktur and blackboard bold alphabets with improved metrics so that subscripts and accent placement are more in line with traditional usage. The mathalfa package has been updated to use these reworked virtual fonts.
