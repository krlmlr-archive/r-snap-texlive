This is the README for the mintspirit package, version 2013-11-02.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX support
for the MintSpirit and MintSpiritNo2 families of fonts, designed by
Hirwen Harendal. MintSpirit was originally designed for use as a
system font on a Linux Mint system. The No. 2 variant provides more
conventional shapes for some glyphs.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system download the file
tex-archive/install/fonts/mintspirit.tds.zip and unzip at the
root of an appropriate texmf tree, likely a personal or local tree. If
necessary, update the file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the
font-map files by enabling the Map file mintspirit.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{mintspirit}

or

\usepackage{mintspirit2}

to the preamble of your document. These will activate MintSpirit or
MintSpiritNo2 as the default sans font. To also set either as the
main text font, use the sfdefault option.

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish to
avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the
fonts.

The default figure style is oldstyle/proportional but options lining
(or lf) and tabular (or tab) allow for use of lining and/or tabular
figures. For local use of non-default figure styles, use

\plstyle        \textpl{ }
\postyle        \textpo{ }
\tlstyle        \texttl{ }
\tostyle        \textto{ }

For superior/inferior figures, use

\sufigures      \textsu{ }
\infigures      \textin{ }

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

Macro \mintspirit (or \mintspirit2) selects the specified family. 

Command \useosf switches the default figure style to old-style
figures; this is primarily for use after calling a math package with
lining figures as the default.

The original fonts (version 1.004) were obtained from

and are licensed under the Open Font License (version 1.1); the text
may be found in the doc directory. The type1 versions were created
using cfftot1. The support files were created using autoinst and are

maintainer of this package is Bob Tennent (rdt at cs.queensu.ca)
