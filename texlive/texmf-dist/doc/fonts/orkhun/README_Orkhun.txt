Among the things which you should know: 
==========================
+ it is necessary to copy  .gf, .pk, .tfm files in the folders:
              ...\TEXMF\fonts\pk
              ...\TEXMF\fonts\tfm
   Or they can be copied in the catalogue (directory) in which you work

+ .gf, .pk, .tfm (ps, dvi) files you can to create, also, using  .mf file 

+ to write the text in old Turkic language you should use a command \font (it is direct in the text).
==========================

Further we plan to write a orkhun-package which will allow to work more conveniently with these fonts and will expand possibilities use of fonts.
