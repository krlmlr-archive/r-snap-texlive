Version 1.4 of the AE fonts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a set of virtual fonts building, from the standard CM fonts,
a set of almost T1 encoded fonts. The characters missing are mainly:
eth, thorn, and the sami letter eng. Sometimes the £ character is
also missing. For the typewriter fonts, the situation is worse.

My idea with these fonts is that it should be possible to use the
exisiting Type1 versions of the CM fonts to produce PDF files even
when one needs hyphenation patterns other than English.

It would be nice to have a font containing the missing caracters, in
order to make the layout fully T1. By the way, the name AE fonts was
chosen since the fonts are Almost European Computer Modern.

To use the fonts, simply \usepackage{ae}.

To use bitmap versions of the characters missing in the ae fonts,
\usepackage{aecompl}.

Denis Roegel has constructed a separate package, aeguill, to produce
guillemets built with the polish CMR fonts, WNCYR fonts, LASY fonts,
or EC fonts.

Changes since version 1.3:

* Apparently, cmr5 does not contain any f-ligatures. Corrected the
  fontinst script to create faked ones instead.

Changes since version 1.2:

* The sans-serif slides fonts were added. Gilbert Ritschard contributed
  support for those fonts in ae.sty; if the option [slides] is given,
  the sans-serif slides fonts are used.

Changes since version 1.1:

* Matthias Köppe contributed an adjustment of the positioning of
  umlauts and better kerning in some cases.

* Added the files omsaer.fd and omlaer.fd to get rid of some
  LaTeX warnings.

Changes since version 1.0:

* Denis Roegel contributed aecompl.sty; a style file which adds
  (as bitmaps) the characters missing in the ae fonts.

Changes since version 0.9:

* ae.sty no longer fails if the EC fonts are not installed.
* The fi-type ligatures in aecsc are fixed.

Changes since version 0.8:

* Rolf Niepraschk contributed ae.sty.
* Some character heights and depths were corrected.
