`Computer Modern Bright' is a family of sans serif fonts for
TeX and LaTeX, based on Donald Knuth's `Computer Modern'.
It comprises OT1, T1 and TS1 encoded text fonts of various
shapes as well as all the fonts necessary for mathematical
typesetting, including the AMS symbols.  CM Bright is
accompanied by a matching family of monospaced fonts,
`Computer Modern Typewriter Light'.

This distribution includes the fonts in the Metafont format
in the directory fonts/source/public/cmbright and the font
metrics in the directory fomnts/tfm/public/cmbright,

The CM Bright and CM typewriter Light fonts are available in
the Type1 (Postscript) format, too.  
See <http://www.micropress-inc.com/fonts>.

Use of the typefaces with LaTeX is supported through the
macro package cmbright.sty.  Its documentation
(doc/latex/cmbright/cmbright.pdf) constitutes also a font 
sample.
