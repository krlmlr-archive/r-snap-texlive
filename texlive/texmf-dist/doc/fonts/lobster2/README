This is the README for the LobsterTwo package, version 2014-01-08.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX support
for the Lobster Two family of fonts, designed by Pablo Impallari.
This is a family of script fonts with many ligatures and terminal
forms; for the best results, use XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. There are two
weights and italic variants for both.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system download the file
tex-archive/install/fonts/lobster2.tds.zip and unzip at the root of an
appropriate texmf tree, likely a personal or local tree. If necessary,
update the file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the font-map files
by enabling the Map file LobsterTwo.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{LobsterTwo}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate Lobster Two
as the main (serifed) text font. 

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish to
avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the
fonts.

The only figure style supported is proportional-lining. Font encodings
supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1; for best results, use LY1.

Macro \LobsterTwo selects the Lobster Two family.

created using fontforge. The support files and the type1 variants
were created using autoinst and are licensed under the terms of the
