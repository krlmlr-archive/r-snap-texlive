This is the README for the librebaskerville package, version 2013-09-20.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX support for
the Libre Baskerville family of fonts, designed by Pablo Impallari.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system download the file
tex-archive/install/fonts/librebaskerville.tds.zip and unzip at the
root of an appropriate texmf tree, likely a personal or local tree. If
necessary, update the file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the
font-map files by enabling the Map file LibreBaskerville.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{librebaskerville}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate Libre Baskerville
as the main (serifed) text font. A bold italic variant of Libre
Baskerville is not currently available; an artificially slanted version
has been generated and treated as if it were italic.

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish to
avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the
fonts.

The only figure style supported is proportional-lining. Font encodings
supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

Macro \librebaskerville selects the Libre Baskerville family.

The original fonts are available at
http://www.impallari.com/projects/overview/libre-baskerville and are

found in the doc directory. The opentype and type1 versions were created
using fontforge. The support files were created using autoinst and

maintainer of this package is Bob Tennent (rdt at cs.queensu.ca)
