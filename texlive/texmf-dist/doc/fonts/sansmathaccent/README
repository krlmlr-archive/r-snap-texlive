Sans serif math (produced by the beamer class or the sfmath package)
often has accents positioned incorrectly.

This package fixes the positioning of math accents when the default font
(cmssi) is used for sans serif math.

It will have no effect if used in a document that does not use the
beamer class or the sfmath package.

This package is released under the LaTeX Project Public License. See
