This is the bguq font, a font which contains a single character: 
the Begriffsschrift quantifier, in several sizes, used to set the
Begriffsschrift (concept notation) of Frege.

This package is not intended for end users, instead it is expected
that it will be used by other packages which implement the 
Begriffsschrift. Josh Parsons' begriff package 

  http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/begriff/

or a derivative of it would be the obvious candidates.  An example 
of such usage can be found in the included style file begriff-bguq.sty,
which is an unofficial and modified version of Parsons' begriff.sty,
included only as an illustration of how package maintainers might 
use the font.

The file begriff-bguq.sty is a derivative work of begriff.sty
