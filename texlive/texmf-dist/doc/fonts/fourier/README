1 VERSION
This version number is 1.4.1 (2005-1-30)
NEW in version 1.4.1:

* no more gap in long arrows symbols

* two new symbols: \decosix and \starredbullet

* Bernard Gaulle's Makefile come back.


NEW in version 1.4 (2005-1-1):

* The widespace option works again (was broken in 1.3)

* Bold versions of FML encoded fonts (essentially greek and latin letters).
Thanks to Timur Mukhamedjanov who designed a first version that was
already pretty good.
The \boldmath command and the bm package seem to be correctly supported.

* Variants of varpi and partialdiff symbols (closer to the cm design). 
The commands are \varvarpi and \varpartialdiff.

* New amssymb-like symbols (\leftleftarrows, \rightrightarrows, \square, 
\blacksquare, \curvearrowleft, \curvearrowright, \subsetneqq).

* Ornaments are now provided by the fourier-orns package, which is required
 by fourier, but may be called separately.

* New ornaments symbols. The commands are \decothreeleft 
\decothreeright \decofourleft \decofourright, \floweroneleft, \floweroneright,
\lefthand, \righthand, \bomb.

* No more gap between the square root and its overbar. Thanks to Hans Hagen
 and Sebastian Sturm who find that (it was an italic correction problem).

* \rmdefaut redefinition made before calling fontenc (in order to 
allow fourier usage even if cork-encoded cm aren't insalled).
Thanks to Robin Fairbanks who pointed that out.

* Capital greek letters are now mathord (instead of mathalpha). Thanks
to Yvon Henel who reported that.

* Metrics improved in math... (I hope!). Thanks to all who reported
metrics features. I do my best to do correction, but it is a long way... 

* The \widehat and \widetilde symbols are no longer intercepted by amssymb.
(Thanks to Peter Harmand for his help).

NEW in  version 1.3 (2004-03-12).

* There is now an UNIX makefile. Many thanks to Bernard Gaulle
who made it.

* Bug corrected in the ornaments font (the Poscript name didn't match
 fourier.map)

* There is a new symbol in the ornament font.


NEW in version 1.2 (LaTeX Companion 2) 2004-03-02

* Bug corrected in fourier.map. Thanks to Walter Schmidt for pointing this
out.

* The titling fonts are now named putrd8a.pfb, futrd8r.tfm, futrd8t.tfm,
futrd8t.vf, according to the Karl Berry scheme. Thanks to Dr Peter Schenzel
for pointing this out.

* The commands \dblbrackleft and \dblbrackright are deprecated and replaced
by \llbracket and \rrbracket.

* It is now possible to call amsmath after fourier. Collaboration between the
two packages had been improved (many thanks to Walter Schmidt).

* There is a new option (widespace) which enlarge the default interword space
of Utopia

* There is a new ornament font with 15 new symbols.

* The \eurologo is now in the ornament font (was in a wrong place in the
TS1 encoding, shame on me). Thanks to Frank Mittelbach and Thierry Bouche
for their help.

* All character codes are now decimal number (no more clash with 
(n)german.sty). Thanks to Walter Schmidt for pointing this out.




2 LICENCE
The licence of fourier-GUTenberg is lppl (latex public
project licence). All the files of this distribution remain in directories 
wich name is "fourier".
texmf/dvips/fourier
texmf/fonts/tfm/public/fourier
texmf/fonts/type1/public/fourier
texmf/fonts/vf/public/fourier
texmf/tex/latex/fourier

BEWARE
fourier uses utopia as his base font. Utopia has been gracefully donated by 
Adobe but his licence is more restrictive than LPPL (it is nocharge and 
freely distributable software, but it's *not* free software.)
Four files are concerned by this licence :
texmf/fonts/type1/adobe/utopia/putr8a.pfb
texmf/fonts/type1/adobe/utopia/putri8a.pfb
texmf/fonts/type1/adobe/utopia/putb8a.pfb
texmf/fonts/type1/adobe/utopia/putbi8a.pfb

And here is the licence of utopia

% The following notice accompanied the Utopia font:
%
%   Permission to use, reproduce, display and distribute the listed
%   typefaces is hereby granted, provided that the Adobe Copyright notice
%   appears in all whole and partial copies of the software and that the
%   following trademark symbol and attribution appear in all unmodified
%   copies of the software:
%
%           Copyright (c) 1989 Adobe Systems Incorporated
%           Utopia (R)
%           Utopia is a registered trademark of Adobe Systems Incorporated
%
%   The Adobe typefaces (Type 1 font program, bitmaps and Adobe Font
%   Metric files) donated are:
%
%           Utopia Regular
%           Utopia Italic
%           Utopia Bold
%           Utopia Bold Italic

Note that Adobe sells two packages of fonts (utopia = 6 fonts, and utopia 
expert = 16 fonts) which are fully usable with fourier (see expert and 
oldstyle options below).

3 - INSTALLATION
The texmf tree provides a standard TDS.
You have to install all the "fourier" directories of the fourier texmf tree 
in one of yours texmf trees.

If you don't still have the four utopia fonts (texmf/fonts/type1/adobe/utopia/), 
you have to install them too.

If you have a licence for the commercial utopia packages, you have to 
rename the *.pfb files to suit the declarations in fourier-utopia-expert.map
 (or to modify this file). Mac fonts should be contverted to pfb format (with 
t1unmac, for instance).

4 - CONFIGURATION
With updmap
run 
% updmap --enable Map fourier.map

if you need to install the commercial packages

% updmap --enable Map fourier-utopia-expert.map

If you don't have updmap or don't want to use it
For dvips, add these lines in config.ps
p +fourier.map
eventually
p +fourier-utopia-expert.map

For pdf(la)tex add these lines in pdftex.cfg
map +fourier.map
eventually
map +fourier-utopia-expert.map

If you have problems when installing fourier, please tell me.

5 - USAGE

If you need more symbols ask me (I don't promise anything if you need a 
complete alphabet!)

Usage : \usepackage[<options>]{fourier}
Don't call \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} or \usepackage{textcomp} as they are 
already loaded by fourier.


The options are

*  maths : sloped (default) and upright. With upright greek lowercases are 
upright and so are roman uppercases (a la french!). 

\otheralpha, \otherbeta, etc. can be used to switch to the other-sloped 
greek symbol.

* text :
-- poorman (default) the 4 standard fonts
-- expert: expert full set (if you have the fonts!) with lining digits
-- oldstyle: expert set with oldstyle text digits
-- fulloldstyle: expert set with oldstye digits in text and in math.

with the three last options the following commands are provided
\sbseries \textsb semi-bold
\blackseries \textblack extra-bold
\titleshape \texttitle titling (caps only)

 \lining and \oldstyle allow you to change the style of digits (use them in 
a group).

amsmath compatibility: full (I hope).

amssymb :
No need to call it if you only need:

\mathbb (A..Z, 1, k)

\leqslant\geqslant\vDash\intercal\blacktriangleleft\blacktriangleright
\nleqslant\ngeqslant\nparallel\complement\hslash\nexists\varsubsetneq

If you need others amssymb symbols please, call amssymb *before* fourier

Other commands:

A slanted parallel symbol (french poeple like it!)
$\parallelslant$
$\nparallelslant$

More integrals
$\iint,\iiint$
$\oiint,\oiiint,\slashint$
\[\iint,\iiint,\oiint,\oiiint,\slashint\]

A special QED symbol for a false proof (of course you need it, don't you ?)
$\thething$

XSwords symbols
$\xswordsup$ $\xswordsdown$
