This is the README for the ebgaramond package, version 0.16
(2014-07-07).

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the EB Garamond family of fonts, designed by
Georg Duffner.

EB Garamond is a revival of the 16th century fonts designed
by Claude Garamont. The source for the letterforms is
a scan of a specimen known as the "Berner specimen",
which, composed in 1592 by Conrad Berner, son-in-law of
Christian Egenolff and his successor at the Egenolff
print office, shows Garamont's roman and Granjon's italic
fonts at different sizes. Hence the name of this project:
Egenolff-Berner Garamond.

Currently only upright and italic variants in medium weight
are available. The medium series will be automatically
substituted for bold.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/ebgaramond.tds.zip, where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirror.ctan.org.
Unzip the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree,
likely a personal or local tree. If necessary, update the
file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the font-map
files by enabling the Map file EBGaramond.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{ebgaramond}

to the preamble of your document. Options include:

oldstyle,osf    old-style figures
lining,nf,lf    lining figures

proportional,p  varying-width figures
tabular,t       fixed-width figures

The defaults are oldstyle and proportional.

Available shapes include:

it              italic
sc              small caps
scit            italic small caps

Slanted variants are not supported; the italic variants will
be automatically substituted. Font encodings supported are
OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to adjust
fontsizes. The type1 option may be used by xelatex or lualatex users
who prefer to use type1 fonts or to avoid fontspec.

Commands \oldstylenums{...} and \liningnums{...} are defined to allow
for local use of old-style figures or lining figures, respectively.
Similarly, \tabularnums{...} and \proportionalnums{...} allow for local
use of monospaced or varying-width figures, respectively.

Superior numbers (for footnote markers) are available
using \sufigures or \textsu{...}. Inferior numbers (for
subscripts) are available using \infigures or \textinf{...}.
Swash italic glyphs (for some letters) are available using
\swshape or \textsw{...}.

Command \textin{...} produces decorative initials; currently
only the following glyphs are available: A, D, F, G, L, N,
O, Q, T and X.

A configuration file for microtype usage is included.
