The home page for the original SIL Gentium font family is
http://scripts.sil.org/Gentium.

The home page for this TeX package, gentium-tug, is http://tug.org/gentium.
This TeX package consists of:

1. The original (unaltered) GentiumPlus, GentiumBook, and other
Gentium-family fonts in TrueType format, as developed by SIL and
released under the OFL (see OFL.txt and OFL-FAQ.txt).

2. Converted fonts in PostScript Type 1 format, released under the same
terms.  These incorporate the name "Gentium" by permission of SIL given
to the TeX Users Group.

3. ConTeXt, LaTeX and other supporting files under the Expat license,
text given below (also at http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Expat).

4. Documentation: the TeX-specific documentation is in
gentium.{tex,pdf}.  We have also included the original documentation,
fontlogs, and other files from the SIL distribution, entirely unaltered,
in the Gentium*/ subdirectories here.

The contributors are listed in the FONTLOG.txt files.


ENCODINGS:
=========
The package provides font files needed for both Unicode XeTeX and LuaTeX
as well as 8-bit engines such as pdfTeX and TeX (->dvips).

For 8-bit engines the following encodings are available:
- Latin:
  ot1      OT1 - default encoding in TeX
  ec       T1  - for most European languages
  texnansi LY1 - for most Western European languages
  l7x      L7x - for Baltic languages
  qx       QX  - for Polish
  t5       T5  - for Vietnamese
  ts1      TS1 - TeX symbols (for LaTeX)

- Greek:
  agr      (only supported in ConTeXt)
  lgr      (only supported in LaTeX)

- Cyrillic:
  t2a      T2A
  t2b      T2B
  t2c      T2C
  x2       X2

TODO:
====
- check that there are no f-ligatures in the encodings X2, LGR
  and possibly AGR

- Add kerning pairs for Cyrillic.

- Add more kerning pairs for accented Latin letters. Currently, there
  are kerning pairs mostly for the combination of one accented letter
  and a letter without accent. There are just several kerning pairs
  for the combination of two accented letters, mostly useful for Czech
  and Slovak.

- Look at the letter Lcaron if the accent should be moved to the left
  (reported to SIL).

- The combination of two commas seems not to give quotedblbase in T1.
  Check it and correct using lig file if needed.

- when/if bold variants of Gentium are released,
  either remove Gentium Basic or create a complete set.
