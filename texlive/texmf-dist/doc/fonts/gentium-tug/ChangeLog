- More doc and distribution tweaks, resent to Victor. (Karl)

2013-04-27
- At the request of Victor Gaultney, changed the advance width of
  the letters dcaron and lcaron back to the original value.  Replaced
  with some extra kerning pairs for the more common combinations. (Pavel)

2013-03-20
- Added license statement to more files, tweak docs. (Karl)

2013-03-14
- Updated Gentium Plus fonts. (Pavel)

2013-03-10
- Changed 'gentium' into 'gentium-tug' by request of SIL. (Mojca)

2013-02-27
- Added a script to create CTAN-friendly directory structure. (Mojca)

2012-04-11
- Added test files and samples for the differences between the
  original TrueType and converted Type 1 fonts. (Pavel) 

2012-04-07
- Corrected letters Tcedilla and Tcommaaccent in the extra kerning
  pairs added to the Type 1 fonts. (Pavel)
- Test file for LGR shows also the italic style. (Pavel)

2012-03-30
- Added more kerning pairs for accented letters to the Type 1
  fonts. (Pavel)
- Corrected the kern value for DV in GentiumPlus Regular in the
  Type 1 fonts. The value was positive. (Pavel)

2012-03-22
- Added more kerning pairs for accented letters to the Type 1
  fonts. (Pavel)

2012-03-20
- The scripts for the conversion of the fonts to Type1 can add
  kerning pairs for accented Latin letters now. The original TTF
  fonts have no such kerning pairs. More such kerning pairs should
  be added. (Pavel)

2012-03-14
- Added several kerning pairs for small caps in the Type 1 version of
  GentiumPlus (original TTFs have no kerning pairs for small caps).
  They were added for these combinations: small cap + small cap
  (currently without accents), capital letter + small cap and some
  punctuation symbols preceeded or followed by small cap letter.
  All these kerning pairs are created automatically and they are derived
  from the respective kerning pairs for capital letters. (Pavel)

2012-03-07
- The Type 1 fonts have "TeX Users Group" as creator now. (Pavel)
- Added license header to some files. (Pavel)

2012-02-27
- Added FamilyBlues and FamilyOtherBlues to Type 1 fonts. The fonts
  can not be one family (t1lint complained), therefore two fonts
  from GentiumPlus are one family and two fonts from GentiumBasic
  are other family. (Pavel)
- ForceBold set explicitly (true or false) for Type 1 fonts. (Pavel)
- Added new targets "test" and "kerns" for the makefile building
  Type 1 fonts. (Pavel)
- Small clean-up of the Type 1 build scripts. (Pavel)

2012-02-14
- Update of the PDF/LaTeX documentation. (Pavel)

2012-02-10
- Added build scripts for Type 1 fonts to the subdirectory "type1" in
  "source". The fonts are not reencoded to Adobe Standard Encoding (which
  created many slots containing ".notdef"). (Pavel)

2012-02-07
- Update of the PDF/LaTeX documentation. (Pavel)

2012-02-06
- The build scripts for the conversion of the fonts to Type 1 remove
  the lookups "mark" and "mkmk" after opening the TrueType font. This
  eliminates really huge amount of error messages for GentiumPlus.
  The scripts print messages about the current operation now. (Pavel)

2012-02-05
- Remove old scripts and refactor ruby sources. (Mojca)
- Different formatting in map files, no functional changes; map files
  for ot1, ts1, lgr, t2b, t2c, x2 may be removed in future (Mojca)
- Fix dotlessj (uni0237) in some encodings;
  fix scommaaccent & some greek letters in qx encoding. (Mojca)

2012-01-16
- Created first serious version of Type 1 fonts based on the script
  by Clea F. Rees. Added kerning pairs for the combinations
  accent + capital Greek letter. The letters dcaron and lcaron made

- Update map files with new names and split gentium.map into
  gentium-truetype.map & gentium-type1.map. (Mojca)
