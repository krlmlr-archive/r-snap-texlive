This work consists of the files listed in drmfilelist.txt.

The drm package provides access to the DRM (Don's Revised
Modern) family of fonts, which includes a variety of optical
sizes in Roman (in four weights), italic, and small caps,
among other shapes, along with a set of symbols and
ornaments.  It is intended to be a full-body text font, but
its larger sizes can also be used for simple display
purposes, and its significant body of symbols can stand on
its own.  It comes complete with textual (``old-style'') and
lining figures, and even has small-caps figures along with
superior and inferior figures.  It also comes with
extensible decorative rules to be used with ornaments from
itself or other fonts, along with an extremely flexible
ellipsis package.  A set of decorative initials is planned.

This package should run properly on any properly running LaTeX
system.  It's been tested specifically with TeXLive on Linux (3.2.0
kernel).
