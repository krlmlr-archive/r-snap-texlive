hfoldsty fonts
==============

The hfoldsty package provides virtual fonts for using oldstyle
(0123456789) figures with the European Computer Modern fonts.
It does a similar job as the eco package by Sebastian
Kirsch <skirsch@t-online.de> but includes a couple of
improvements, e.g., better kerning with guillemets, support for
character protruding using the pdfcprot package, arbitrary font
sizes in conjunction with fix-cm.sty.

The distribution contains of two zip files:
- hfoldsty-v#_##.zip contains the files you have to install to use the 
  hfoldsty fonts.
- hfoldsty-src-v#_##.zip contains the shell scripts, fontinst and latex
  source codes that have been used to generate the installation files
  in hfoldsty-v#_##.zip. If you are not really sure what you are doing 
  don't touch that file.

Installation in a TDS TeX implementation:

Change to the LocalTeXMF directory
(e.g., `c:\Programme\TeXLive\texmf-local', `/usr/TeX/texmf-local',
`/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf-local') and unzip hfoldsty-v#_##.zip (where
#_## stands for the version). Then refresh the TeX file database by
using the Start Menu or `texhash'.


The hfoldsty fonts have been developed starting from the eco fonts by
Sebastian Kirsch <skirsch@t-online.de>. Many thanks to him for his great
work.
