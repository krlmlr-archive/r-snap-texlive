 Droid, version 2.1
--------------------

The Droid typeface family was designed in the fall of 2006 by Ascender's Steve
Matteson, as a commission from Google to create a set of system fonts for its
Android platform. The goal was to provide optimal quality and comfort on a
mobile handset when rendered in application menus, web browsers and for other
screen text. The Droid family of fonts consists of Droid Serif, Droid Sans and
Droid Sans Mono, licensed under the Apache License version 2.0, and available in
the Android Git at
http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/frameworks/base.git;a=tree;f=data/fonts
as TrueType files.

This package provides support for this font family in LaTeX. It includes the
original TrueType fonts, as well as Type 1 versions, converted for this package
using FontForge for full support with Dvips.

Notice that this package does not support the Droid Pro family sold by Ascender.

Installation and usage instructions are described in
doc/latex/droid/droid.pdf.

This package is released under the LaTeX Project Public License, either version
1.3c or above, with the exception of the .ttf and .pfb files, released under the
Apache License version 2.0.
