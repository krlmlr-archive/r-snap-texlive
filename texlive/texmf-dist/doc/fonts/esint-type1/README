Eddie Saudrais's font esint10 in Adobe PostScript Type 1 format
by Martti Nikunen (martti.nikunen@helsinki.fi).

This PostScript Type 1 implementation of the font esint10, originally
created by Eddie Saudrais using METAFONT, is freely available for general
use.

The conversion was done with the free mftrace program
(http://www.xs4all.nl/~hanwen/mftrace/).

This distribution does not contain the TFM files that are necessary to
use the fonts with TeX; the TFM files can be generated from the Metafont
sources obtained by following the instructions in
CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/esint.

The fragment for the dvips mapfile is simply

esint10  esint10  <esint10.pfb

and the line in updmap.cfg for teTeX should be

MixedMap esint.map
