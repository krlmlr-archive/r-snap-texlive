\section{Preface}

This users guide is intended to serve as a help and supplement to the
Washington State University International Phonetic Alphabet (\wsu) fonts.
It is not intended to be a manual on \TeX, linguistics, or the correct usage of
the characters, accents and diacritics contained within the font.
It is assumed that the user is familiar with the version of \TeX\ he or she is
using and with the characters contained within the \wsu\ font.
Because the uses for a phonetic alphabet font are probably as varied as the
many disciplines which use the characters, this guide is intended to merely
show some of the most common ways of using the \wsu\ font. Surely each person
who implements the font will develop his or her own favorite way of working with
 and
using the font.

The principal
source of information regarding the characters and their shapes has come from
sources within the linguistic field---most
notably, Geoffrey K. Pullum and William A. Ladusaw, whose book, {\it Phonetic
Symbol Guide} was used extensively.
The \PL\  not only lists the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) characters
and diacritics, it also
gives an enlarged illustration of each character which shows its baseline,
height, depth and x-height. These character illustrations were invaluable
in the design of the \wsu\ \meta\ characters.

Several other people involved
in the wonderful world of linguistics also aided in the design of the \wsu\
font. Their input concerning everything
from character shape, to placement within the font, to determining which
characters should be included, is gratefully acknowledged. I would especially
like to thank Karen Mullen, Associate Professor of English, University of
Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky.  She tested, used the \wsu\ fonts, and took
the time to give several suggestions and recommendations that have improved
the font. Also, Christina A. Thiele, Managing Director, Journal Production
 Centre,
Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario, who not only provided a wealth
of phonetic information, but also a wealth of encouragement throughout
the entire font designing process.


Included with the \wsu\ fonts are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
The basic \wsu\ font which contains 128 phonetic characters
and/or diacritics in five different point sizes (8,
9, 10, 11 and 12) and in
three typefaces (roman, slanted and bold extended).

\item Each size and typeface includes a TFM (\TeX\ Font Metric)
file and its related GF, PK or PXL file.

\item A macro package (\ipam.TEX) for use with the \wsu\ font, and

\item the {\it WSUIPA Font User's Guide}.
\end{enumerate}

This guide is divided into three main sections: 1) an introduction to the \wsu\
font,
2) a description of the font layout and the characters included in the font
and 3) some \TeX niques for use with the \wsu\  fonts.

Although the \wsu\ fonts are written in \meta , the user does not need
experience with or knowledge of \meta\ to use the font. However, at least a
beginning understanding of \TeX\ and the use of fonts in the \TeX\ environment
{\it is} necessary. For information about either \TeX\ or font usage in \TeX ,
see {\it The \TeX book} by Donald Knuth.

\section{Introduction to the WSUIPA Font}

The \wsu\  fonts are written in \meta\ and use the same font parameter values
as their Computer Modern (CM) counterparts (cmr and cmbx). In fact, while
designing the character shapes, the computer modern code was left intact or
modified only slightly whenever possible. Therefore, the \wsu\  fonts
are totally compatible with computer modern fonts---the design and shape
of the characters are computer modern wherever possible. For the characters
that are drastically different from any computer modern characters or symbols,
such as the ``Gamma,'' ``Baby Gamma'' and the ``Esh,'' Pullum and Ladusaw's
{\it Phonetic Symbol Guide} was used as the character design
standard.

The \wsu\  fonts are obviously not an exhaustive collection of phonetic or
even recognized International Phonetic Alphabet characters. The characters
included in the \wsu\  font were chosen either because they were listed
as a ``major'' entry in Pullum and Ladusaw's {\it Guide\/},
or because of the recommendations from
various people with an interest in the font.

The {\it Guide} contains what it classifies as ``major'' and ``minor''
characters, based upon whether the symbol is an officially recognized IPA
character or is determined by Pullum and Ladusaw
to be a standard symbol in current American
transcriptual practice. The {\it Guide}
lists 78 ``major'' entries which are not easily
attainable in the CM fonts. All 78 of these characters are included in the
\wsu\  font, along with 50 ``minor'' entries from the {\it Guide}.
The selection of which
``minor'' entries to include was based on information and requests from
various phoneticians and linguists who contacted WSU during the beginning
stages of the creation of the font.

\section{The Layout of the WSUIPA Font}

The character-grouping pattern followed by Pullum and Ladusaw in their
{\it Guide} was adopted as the basis
for the \wsu\ font layout. The characters
are grouped together according to shape rather than usage. Therefore,
the ``a'' shapes occupy
the first positions: '00 through '04, ``b'' shapes are in positions '05
through '11 and so forth. The accents and diacritics follow the character
shapes and are in the last positions in the font. This approach was taken
because under it was assumed that under most circumstances,
the user would most likely be accessing the characters with the use of macros
rather than by typing large portions of entirely phonetic text.
Aside from keeping like shapes together, the positioning of the
\wsu\  font was fairly arbitrary.

\section{Character Description}

Within this section each of the \wsu\  characters are shown in a \meta\
``smoke mode'' proof. The octal character position is indicated, along with the
corresponding macro name in \ipam, and the
name of the character given in P\&L.
Only the roman characters will be illustrated since the shapes of the slanted
and bold extended are the same.

There are several Greek characters included in the \wsu\ font, and initially
it may appear these are merely copies of the corresponding CM Greek characters.
That is true with one very important distinction: the \wsu\ Greek characters
included are not italic. All the lowercase Greek characters included in
the CM fonts are italic which makes them unsuitable for some situations in
phonetics where a non-italic Greek character is essential.

\section{Using the {\tt ipalmacs} style option}

  The {\tt ipalmcas} document style option loads the \wsu\ fonts and changes
  them automatically according to the specified fontsize, fontseries and
  fontshape. You need a \LaTeX\ with the {\em New Font Selection Scheme} (NFSS)
  by Sch\"opf and Mittelbach. This is available from all the wellknown
  \TeX\ servers.

  Use the {\tt ipalmacs} option by adding it as an optional argument to the
  \verb:\documentstyle: command, i.e. type
\begin{verbatim}
  \documentstyle[ipalmacs]{article}
\end{verbatim}
  at the very beginning of your document. Of course, {\tt ipalmacs} also works
  with {\tt report} and {\tt book} style.

To access individual \wsu\ characters within sentences set in Computer Modern,
you need only to enter the \ipam\ command. For example,
\begin{verbatim}
A shibilant is a term occasionally found for a fricative
corresponding to
a ``hushing'' sound, e.g., IPA [\esh] (more technically,
a grooved laminal fricative).
\end{verbatim}
\noindent which will print as:
\vs{5pt}
{\bf
A shibilant is a term occasionally found for a fricative
corresponding to
a ``hushing'' sound, e.g., IPA [\esh] (more technically,
a grooved laminal fricative).
}
\vs{5pt}

The {\tt ipalmacs} character macros are defined so they can be used with the CM
characters and accents without the need for delimiting curly braces. By using
the {\tt ipalmacs}
definitions, you can use the CM accents with a \wsu\ character in the
same way you would accent a CM character. The following input

\begin{verbatim}
The superscript tilde is a nasalization marker for vowels,
thus [\tilde\scripta] is a nasalized [\scripta].
\end{verbatim}
\noindent will print as:
\vs{5pt}
{\bf The superscript tilde is a nasalization marker for vowels, thus
[\~\scripta] is a nasalized [\scripta].
}
\vs{5pt}

The \wsu\ accents can be used with CM characters. However, only the \wsu\
``\dental'' and ``\underarch'' have been defined in {\tt ipalmacs} and both are
diacritics which go under a character.
To use any other \wsu\ character as an accent either with a CM character or with
another \wsu\ character, you can define the \wsu\ accent
in the same way that the CM accents are defined.

There are three control sequences provided from smart accenting.

\verb:\oaccent: is used for typesetting an accent over any letter. The input
\verb:\oaccent{\overring}{g}: will produce a \oaccent{\overring}{g}.

Most of the \wsu\ diacritics are intended to go under characters, like the
``underarch'' and ``dental'' mentioned above. The control sequence
\verb:\uaccent: produces a letter with an accent below, for example
\verb:\uaccent{\c{}}{g}: gives you \uaccent{\c{}}{g}. (Note that this result
  cannot achieved by just typing
  \verb:\c{g}: which would result in \c{g}---the cedilla being not lowered.)

\verb:\taccent: is somewhat special. It puts a diacritic designed to go under
  a letter over it. It is needed for the lattvian special letter
  \taccent{\polishhook}{g}, which you get by typing
  \verb:\taccent{\polishhook}{g}:.

For compatibility with the original \ipam\ package, the command
  \verb:\diatop: is provided. Its use is discouraged within \LaTeX, because it
  is fragile and would need \verb:\protect:ion under many circumstances.
  It is used as \verb:\diatop[\overringºg]:, producing \diatop[\overringºg].

  With the commands given above, you can stack as many diacritcs as you want
  above and below any letter, for example
\begin{verbatim}
  Here are some very special
  \oaccent{\overring}{\uaccent{\underring}{r}},
  \oaccent{\'}{\oaccent{\overring}{n}},
  and \uaccent{\underring}{\dental{d}}.
\end{verbatim}
  will print as

{\bf  Here are some very special
  \oaccent{\overring}{\uaccent{\underring}{r}},
  \oaccent{\'}{\oaccent{\overring}{n}},
  and \uaccent{\underring}{\dental{d}}.
}

\section{Defining your own commands}

Of course, you don't want to get tired by typing several times the same long
  command. You may define your own abbereviations with the help of
  \verb:\newcommand:, like the following:
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\rr}{\uaccent{\underring}{r}} % \rr is a voiceless trilled r
\newcommand{\og}[1]{\uaccent{\polishhook}{#1}} % ogonek below a letter
\end{verbatim}
Afterwards, you can use them like any ordinary \LaTeX\ command.
\begin{verbatim}
A voiceless trilled r [\rr] occurs in certain scottisch dialects.\\
The polish \og{e} is pronounced [\~\niepsilon].
\end{verbatim}
will print as
\newcommand{\rr}{\uaccent{\underring}{r}} % \rr is a voiceless trilled r
\newcommand{\og}[1]{\uaccent{\polishhook}{#1}} % ogonek below a letter

{\bf
A voiceless trilled r [\rr] occurs in certain scottisch dialects.\\
The polish \og{e} is pronounced [\~\niepsilon].
