There are three documents which are used with the IPA. The IPAMAN.TEX document
is written using the TEXT1 macros. The file LIPAMAN.TEX uses LaTeX. Both of
these files imbed IPAMACS.TEX. Another set has been added: IPALMAN.TEX and
IPALMACS.STY which are also typeset with LaTeX. 

For all of these documents, you will need the TFM files in this directory to
format the documents, and the *PK files to print the files. There are also some
DVI files supplied to make things a little easier.
