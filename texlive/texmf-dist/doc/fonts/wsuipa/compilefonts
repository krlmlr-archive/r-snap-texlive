#Here is a shell script, compilefonts, to call mf to generate a set of gf
#fonts in the desired sizes, e.g. for a screen previewer or possibly for a
#400 or 600 dpi printer, and then to call gftopk to convert to pk format
#and finally to remove the gf fonts.  I have also included a help file,
#mf.help.  Please feel free to edit these in any way you see fit.  I have
#tested the script and can guarantee that it works.

The 300pk fonts in this directory should be sufficient for use with most
standard 300dpi laserprinters.  If you use a recent version of dvips, it
will call metafont on the fly to generate the fonts it needs as long as
it can find the .mf files.  If you use xdvi or maxview as your
previewer, the 300pk fonts should be sufficient.  For other previewers,
however, you will probably have to generate your own screen fonts.  The
easiest way to use metafont to do this is with the script, compilefonts,
based on a script, CompileFonts, by James Clark, the author of groff.
However, it is essential that the mode chosen be one which is in
/usr/local/lib/tex/mf/inputs/modes.mf (or wherever on one's installation
this file is kept).  E.g. for 120dpi fonts for dvipage under Sunview,
choose mode=OneTwoZero.  For 110dpi fonts for dvivga under Xenix, use
mode=IBMVGA and dpi=110.  If one is using dvivga under MS-DOS, it will
be necessary to rename the fonts because of filename limitations under
MS-DOS.  Use the directory structure and filenames in your dvivga
installation as a model.

Let me repeat again that the modes MUST be defined in modes.mf.  If
you need the above modes and they are not present, ask your system
administrator to obtain a more up-to-date modes.mf file.  (One should
always be available at a nearby CTAN archive site.)

It is recommended that compilefonts be invoked in the background as
the process can be lengthy (15 minutes on a Sun IPC).  To do this,
type "compilefonts &" at your Unix shell prompt.
