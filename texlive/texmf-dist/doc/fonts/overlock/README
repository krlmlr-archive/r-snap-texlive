This is the README for the Overlock package, version 2014-05-24.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX support
for the Overlock and OverlookSC families of fonts, designed by
Dario Manuel Muhafara of the TIPO foundry (http://www.tipo.net.ar).
These are "rounded" sans-serif fonts in three weights (Regular,
Bold, Black) with italic variants for each of them. There are also
small-caps and old-style figures in the Regular weight.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system download
the file "tex-archive"/install/fonts/overlock.tds.zip, where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirror.ctan.org. Unzip
the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree, likely a
personal or local tree. If necessary, update the file-name database
(e.g., texhash). Update the font-map files by enabling the Map file
overlock.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{overlock}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate Overlock and
OverlockSC as the sans-serif text fonts. To also set these as the
main text fonts, use

\usepackage[sfdefault]{overlock}

The black option will use that weight as the default bold series.

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish
to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the
fonts.

The default figure style is proportional-lining but old-style
figures are available for the regular weight using the small-cap
shape. Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

Command \overlook selects the Overlock and OverlockSC families
and \overlockBlack selects the Black series.

The original fonts are available at http://www.google.com and
are licensed under the SIL Open Font License, (version 1.1); the
text may be found in the doc directory. The type1 versions were
created using fontforge. The support files were created using
autoinst and are licensed under the terms of the LaTeX Project
Public License. The maintainer of this package is Bob Tennent (rdt
at cs.queensu.ca).
