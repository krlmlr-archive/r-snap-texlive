This is the change log of the Euro currency symbol for TeX/LaTeX.
(if you want to complain about anything: theiling@coli.uni-sb.de)

30-Apr-2002:
  - Added licence

6-Aug-1998:
  - added fixes to the mf file to make the symbol look nice in
    many different resolutions and sizes

  - added a lot of text to the testeuro.tex documentation file

  - added commands \EUR, \geneuro etc.

  - moved the documentation to doc subdirectory and changed the
    Makefiles.

  - added a text example with two different shapes of the symbol

  - changed the symbol \char0 in the font to include thin lines
    showing the construction of the symbol and added it to the
    docu.

28-Jul-1998:
  - fixed the amount the bars came out of the symbol on the left.
    The fix is a hack but a good one. :-)

  - added new characters for only the bars for construction of
    Euro currency symbols from other fonts' C characters.  There
    are two widths: 100% and 80%.  This is due to the fact that
    most C's are less wide than the Euro glyph

  - fixed the overunder-amount to match the cmr-C in most of the
    usual sizes

  - changed the bold glyph to look nicer.  simply re-drawing the
    border is ugly

  - threw out the b series and replaced it with bx in the style
    file because it isn't different anymore.  However, for
    compatibility reasons, the b series should be defined.

27-Jul-1998: version 1.0 completed

26-Jul-1998: initial version
