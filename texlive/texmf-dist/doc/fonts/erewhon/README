This package provides LaTeX support files for the Erewhon fonts, made up of fonts files and LaTeX support files for a family based on Andrey V. Panov's Heuristica fonts, version 1.0.1, which were in turn a substantial extension of the free Utopia font family making available Cyrillic glyphs, Small Caps in regular weight, upright shape, and oldstyle fixed-width figures in all styles. Erewhon adds small caps in all styles, slanted shapes distinct from italic, superior letter and figures in all styles, as well as inferior, numerator and denominator figures in all styles. The six font files in this package are in otf and pfb format, licensed under the SIL OFL. All other support files are subject to the LaTeX Project Public License. See 
http://www.ctan.org/license/lppl1.3
for the details of that license. 

Current version: 1.001

Changes in version 1.001
1. Modified BlueValues of fonts to correct problems with t1lint, though t1lint still provokes warnings.
2. Added afm files to distribution.

The otf fonts contain all the kerning and other tables. Should you wish to modify these yourself, the LaTeX support files may be re-created using the command

/usr/texbin/autoinst  --inferiors --fractions --verbose --noupdmap  --noswash --notitling --noornaments --target=./texmf --encoding=TS1,LY1,T2A,T2B,T2C,T1 --vendor=public --typeface=erewhon *.otf

after cding to the folder containing just the modified otf fonts and a subfolder named texmf. You should replace the newly generated erewhon.sty with the one from the distribution in order to preserve its functionality. The names of the encoding files should also be modified appropriately from those assigned by autoinst. I used the following bash shell script, which assumed you are in the directory holding the otf files and a texmf subfolder:

#!/bin/bash
pushd texmf/fonts/map/dvips/erewhon
sed -i '' 's/<\[a_/<\[zut1_/g' erewhon.map
popd
pushd texmf/fonts/enc/dvips/erewhon
for f in *.enc; do mv ${f} zut1${f:1}; done
popd

Installation:

Mac OS X: To install, open a Terminal window and cd to inside the downloaded TDS folder.

Method A (recommended): type

sudo /bin/cp -Rfp * /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local

then

sudo mktexlsr

then

sudo -H updmap-sys --enable Map=erewhon.map

Method B: If you insist on making your font installations in your home folder, potentially making your personal installation become out of sync with updates to TeXLive, use instead

(i) if you checked Update for All Users in TeXLive utility

/bin/cp -Rfp * ~/Library/texmf

then

updmap --enable Map=erewhon.map

(ii) otherwise

/bin/cp -Rfp * ~/Library/texmf

then

sudo updmap-sys --enable Map=erewhon.map

Linux: Very similar to Mac OS X.

MikTeX: Copy erewhon.tds.zip to the root of the folder you use for personal additions to the TeX trees, open a command window, chdir to that folder, and type

unzip erewhon.tds.zip
initexmf --update-fndb
initexmf --edit-config-file updmap

The latter command should open updmap.cfg in your default editor, commonly Notepad. Add the line 

Map erewhon.map 

to updmap.cfg, save and close. Then, in the command window, type

initexmf --mkmaps

You can ignore error messages that may occur here. This should result in a properly enabled erewhon.
