Installation
------------

There's nothing special about building dingbat:

    latex dingbat.ins     <== Generate dingbat.sty
    latex dingbat.dtx     <== Produce the documentation (dingbat.dvi)
    makeindex -s gind.ist dingbat    <== Generate an index
    latex dingbat.dtx     <== Incorporate the index into the document

If you're new to this, see

information on installing packages.
