    The auncial bundle provides packages and fonts for a script based 
on the Artificial Uncial manuscript book-hand used between the 6th & 10th 
century AD. The script consists of minuscules and digits, with some 
appropriate period punctuation marks. Both normal and bold versions are 
provided. This is one of a series for bookhand fonts.

    The font follows the B1 encoding developed for bookhands. Access to
this is essential. The encoding mainly follows the regular T1 encoding.

   If there are any questions please ask them on the comp.text.tex newsgroup.

Changes in version 2.0 (2005/11/27)
o Font supplied as Postscript Type1 instead of MetaFont
o Only B1 encoding supported
o Major code rewrite

Changes in version 1.0 (1999/05/22)

    To install the bundle:
o If you want MetaFont sources uncomment the appropriate lines in auncial.ins.
o run: latex auncial.ins, which will generate:
       auncial.sty
       *.fd files
       auncial.map
       and possibly several *.mf files
o Move *.sty and *.fd files to a location where LaTeX will find them
    e.g., .../texmf-local/tex/latex/auncial
o Move *.afm, *.pfb and *.tfm files to where LaTeX looks for font information
    e.g., .../texmf-var/fonts/afm/public/bookhands/*.afm
          .../texmf-var/fonts/type1/public/bookhands/*.pfb
          .../texmf-var/fonts/tfm/public/bookhands/*.tfm
o Add the *.map information to the dvips/pdftex font maps
   If you want the MetaFont version as well:
   o Move the *.mf files to, e.g., .../texmf-var/fonts/source/public/auncial
   o Add a line like the following to the (texmf/fontname/)special.map file:
     auncl10.mf     public      auncial 
     aunclb10.mf    public      auncial 
o Refresh the database
 (for more information on the above see the FAQ).

o run: (pdf)latex tryauncial for a test of the font

    If you want a full manual with all the MetaFont and LaTeX code and 
commentry, comment out the \OnlyDescription line in auncial.dtx.
o run: (pdf)latex auncial.dtx
o (for an index run: makeindex -s gind.ist *.idx)
o run: (pdf)latex *.dtx
o Print *.(pdf|dvi) for a hardcopy of the package manual
