------------------------
THE IFXETEX PACKAGE v0.6

This very simple package, for both Plain TeX and LaTeX,
defines the \ifxetex boolean for testing whether XeTeX
is being used for typesetting.

Also provides the \RequireXeTeX command which throws
an error if XeTeX is not the engine in use.

To extract the package from the source file "ifxetex.tex",
execute `latex ifxetex.ins`. Executing `xelatex ifxetex.tex`
compiles the documentation and generates this README.
