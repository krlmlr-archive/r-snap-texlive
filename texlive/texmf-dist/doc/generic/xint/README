Abstract
========

xinttools is loaded by xint (hence by all other packages of the
bundle, too): it provides utilities of independent interest such as
expandable and non-expandable loops.

xint implements with expandable TEX macros additions, subtractions,
multiplications, divisions and powers with arbitrarily long numbers.

xintfrac extends the scope of xint to decimal numbers, to numbers in
scientific notation and also to fractions with arbitrarily long such
numerators and denominators separated by a forward slash.

xintexpr extends xintfrac with an expandable parser 
         \xintexpr . . . \relax
of expressions involving arithmetic operations in infix notation on
decimal numbers, fractions, numbers in scientific notation, with
parentheses, factorial symbol, function names, comparison operators,
logic operators, twofold and threefold way conditionals,
sub-expressions, macros expanding to the previous items.

Further modules:

xintbinhex is for conversions to and from binary and hexadecimal
bases.

xintseries provides some basic functionality for computing in an
expandable manner partial sums of series and power series with
fractional coefficients.

xintgcd implements the Euclidean algorithm and its typesetting.

xintcfrac deals with the computation of continued fractions.

Most macros, and all of those doing computations, work purely by
expansion without assignments, and may thus be used almost everywhere
in TeX. The packages may be used with any flavor of TeX supporting the
e-TeX extensions. LaTeX users will use \usepackage and others \input
to load the package components.

Installation
============

A. Installation using xint.tds.zip:
-----------------------------------

obtain xint.tds.zip from CTAN:
  http://mirror.ctan.org/install/macros/generic/xint.tds.zip

cd to the download repertory and issue 
  unzip xint.tds.zip -d <TEXMF>
for example: (assuming standard access rights, so sudo needed)
  sudo unzip xint.tds.zip -d /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
  sudo mktexlsr
 
On Mac OS X, installation into user home folder:
  unzip xint.tds.zip -d  ~/Library/texmf
 
B. Installation after file extractions:
---------------------------------------

obtain xint.dtx, xint.ins and the README from CTAN:
   http://www.ctan.org/pkg/xint

- "tex xint.ins" generates the style files
(pre-existing files in the same repertory will be overwritten).

- without xint.ins: "tex or latex or pdflatex or xelatex xint.dtx" 
will also generate the style files (and xint.ins).

xint.tex is also extracted, use it for the documentation:

- with latex+dvipdfmx: latex xint.tex thrice then dvipdfmx xint.dvi
Ignore dvipdfmx warnings, but if the pdf file has problems with fonts
(possibly from an old dvipdfmx), use then rather pdflatex or xelatex.

- with pdflatex or xelatex: run it directly thrice on xint.dtx, or run 
it on xint.tex after having edited the suitable toggle therein.

Whether compiling xint.tex or xint.dtx, the documentation is by default
produced without inclusion of the source code. See instructions in the
file xint.tex for changing this default.
 
Finishing the installation: (on first installation the destination
repertories may need to be created)

      xinttools.sty |
           xint.sty |
       xintfrac.sty |
       xintexpr.sty | --> TDS:tex/generic/xint/ 
     xintbinhex.sty |
        xintgcd.sty |
     xintseries.sty |
      xintcfrac.sty |

           xint.dtx   --> TDS:source/generic/xint/
           xint.ins   --> TDS:source/generic/xint/
           xint.tex   --> TDS:source/generic/xint/

           xint.pdf   --> TDS:doc/generic/xint/
             README   --> TDS:doc/generic/xint/

Depending on the TDS destination and the TeX installation, it may be
necessary to refresh the TeX installation filename database (mktexlsr)
