      Iterate on comma-separated and filename lists

                (C) Uwe Lueck 2012/11/29


`commado.sty' provides 

               \DoWithCSL{<cmd>}{<list>} 

to apply an existing one-parameter macro <cmd> to each item 
in a list <list> in which items are separated by commas. 

`filesdo.sty' provides 

       \DoWithBasesExts{<cmd>}{<bases>}{<exts>}

to run <cmd>{<base>.<ext>} for some (at most) one-parameter 
macro <cmd>, each base filename <base> in the comma-separated 
list <bases> and each extension <ext> in the comma-separated 
list <exts>. 

As opposed to LaTeX’s internal \@for, no assignments are 
involved (unless <cmd> uses assignments, "expandability" in 
"TeX’s gullet").

Both packages are "generic," i.e., should work with Plain 
TeX, LaTeX or even other formats, relying on the `plainpkg' 
package for some minimal LaTeX-like behaviour.
