                    DOCUMENTATION for PiCTeX

1. The macro file pictex.tex (or pictexwd.tex) contains a sober yet 
comprehensive documentation. 

2. Michael Wichura presented a description in TUGboat 9 (2), 
pp. 193-197 (1988), see 

    http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb09-2/tb21wichura-pictex.pdf

3. Michael Wichura's MANUAL -- today called `PiCTeX and Table Manual'
 -- is distributed by PCTeX: 

    http://www.pctex.com/books.html

4. Other overviews have been presented at least in Helmut Kopka's 
GERMAN books on LaTeX extensions in the 1990s. [Lazy, I know.]

5. Another GERMAN reference list, a quite RECENT one, is Uwe Siart's 
PDF at

    http://www.siart.de/typografie/pictex-referenz.pdf

6. An early command summary has been Angus Duggan's PDF at 

    http://mirror.ctan.org/info/pictex/summary/pictexsum.pdf

7. Chapter 5 and Appendix E of the documentation for the MathsPIC 
package (Perl version) 

    http://mirror.ctan.org/graphics/mathspic/perl/mathsPICmanual.pdf

provide a nicely typeset summary of PiCTeX, of some of its commands, 
and of files around PiCTeX available from the web; somewhat replacing 
the present overview. MathsPIC provides a kind of front-end script 
language for PiCTeX.

8. Similarly, Section 9.9 of the real book (also available as an 
e-book)

    Syropoulos A., Tsolomitis A. and Sofroniou N.: Digital Typography 
    Using LaTeX. Springer, New York 2003, ISBN 978-0387952178

has 10 pages presenting PiCTeX.

concerning basic problems with PiCTeX
