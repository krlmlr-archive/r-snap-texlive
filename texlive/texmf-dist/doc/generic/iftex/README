_________________
The iftex package
v0.2

This very simple package, for both Plain TeX and LaTeX,
defines the \ifPDFTeX, \ifXeTeX, and \ifLuaTeX boolean
for testing whether PDFTeX, or XeTeX, or LuaTeX is being
used for typesetting.

Also provides the \RequirePDFTeX, \RequireXeTeX, and \RequireLuaTeX
command which throws an error if PDFTeX, XeTeX and LuaTeX (respectively)
is not the engine in use.

If you want to report any bugs or typos and corrections in the documentation,
or ask for any new features, or suggest any improvements, or ask any questions
about the package, then please do not send any direct emails to us; we will not 
answer any direct emails. Instead please use the issue tracker:
  <https://github.com/persian-tex/iftex/issues>
In doing so, please always explain your issue well enough, always include
a minimal working examples showing the issue, and always choose the appropriate
label for your query (i.e. if you are reporting any bugs, choose `bug' label).
