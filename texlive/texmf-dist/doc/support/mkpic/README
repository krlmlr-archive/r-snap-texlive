mkpic provides an easy interface for making small pictures with mfpic. To
this end you create an input file has to be created consisting of
commands, one per line, with space separated parameters (or you modify the
DATA section of the mkpic script, which is used if you run it without an
input file). For an extensive description see the file mkpicdoc.pdf, which
is part of the distribution.

Changes with respect to version 0.1:
- added mkpicdoc.tex to the distribution
