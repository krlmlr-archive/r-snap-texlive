2013-02-07 0.6.0

	Command-line component rewritten in TeXLua

	Texlua's epdf library replaces Ghostscript's pdf2dsc.ps.

	Grayscaling done by Ghostscript; both old grayscaling options now
	do the same thing.

	When going from eps to pdf, a PostScript wrapper is no longer
	used. Instead, Ghostscript now takes care of translating the eps
	boundingbox to a pdf MediaBox. This implies that the hires
	boundingbox will be used if available.

	Pdf crop adapted from Heiko Oberdiek's pdfcrop perl script

	ATM custom options for GhostScript and pdftops are no-ops.

	AppleScript wrapper dropped since I no longer own a Mac.

2011-02-27 0.5.3

	Windows: AppData now read from registry, because this value may not
	always be available as environment variable

	AppleScript wrapper now uses `do shell script' with some
	heuristic path additions, instead of `tell application Terminal
	do script'

2010-12-25 0.5.2

	Eliminate need for wrappers under Unix, as suggested by
	Peter Breitenlohner; update manual

2010-05-09 0.5.1

2010-02-28 0.5

	GUI module replaced with separate Tcl/Tk frontend. To this end,
	epspdf.rb now has options for reading/writing settings over
	stdin/stdout.

	Epspdf.rb now also aborts on Unix if Ghostscript is missing.

	Both logs and config moved to subdirectory: %APPDATA%/epspdf
	under Windows, $HOME/.epspdf otherwise. On-demand log window.

	Logo/icon added

	Documentation updates

	Manual in info format is now part of the distribution

2009-09-11 0.4.3

	Patch for Ruby 1.9 compatibility (Ruben Stein). Patch for

	gRAY with ps => pdf. `epspdf --version' now prints
	version. Documentation updates.

	add-on.

2009-03-02 0.4

	Handles hires boundingbox. Can use MikTeX Ghostscript. Updated,
	streamlined Ruby subset. Simpler testing of prerequisites.  In
	particular, no pdftops version testing. More tolerant boundingbox
	parsing. Windows: View with... button. OS X: use open command for
	viewing. Converting... text in main window.

	calls, not between program sessions). Changes in documentation.
