Epspdf is an ps/eps/pdf converter which can be used both from the
command-line and as a GUI application.

Full documentation is available in the doc subdirectory.

Windows users: you may prefer the Windows setup program instead. It
is available from http://tex.aanhet.net/epspdf/ and on CTAN as
epspdf-extra. The setup program already provides the necessary
pieces of Tcl/Tk.
