% We want the roman digits from the corresponding cmr font, and that's
% all.  Therefore, we don't want to obey the `generate' command in
% cmr??.mf.  To do this, we read in cmbase, and then set generate to
% gobble its argument. 
def gobble primary g=enddef;	% gobbles its argument
input cmbase;			% Read it explicitly, rather than
				% implicitly within cmr10
