% \section{Introduction}
%
% This package contains the \MF{} source and driver files for the
% \ar{} font families, type1 files for the main varieties, plus a \LaTeX{}
% package to utilize those fonts, along with a number of font definition
% files, as required by the New Font Selection Scheme (\NFSS{}).
%
% \subsection{About the Documentation}
%
% The full documentation of this font and package is rather large, something like 187
% pages actually. Most of it is the \MF{} programs for the characters for
% the fonts; to make them visible, just remove the
% \texttt{\bslash OnlyDescription} from the preamble of \texttt{allrunes.dtx}.
%
% \subsection{Notes on Installation}
% The information in this documentation can be usefull if you intend to
% install the \ar{} font and package, and it is intended be sufficient.
% However, in some TeX-implementations (like MiKTeX) the \ar{} font and package
% is part of the distribution; in such cases it is easier to use that.
%
% \section{The Fonts}
% Both \MF{} source files and type1 font files are supplied. It is recommended to
% install either just the \MF{} files, or both of them.
%
% \subsection{The \MF{} files}
%
% \paragraph{Base File and Source Files}
% The names of the base file and the files containing the code for the characters of
% the \ar{} font all starts with the letters \texttt{fru}. The next five
% possible letters reflects
% what kind of code is contained within the file, e.g., the base file
% ends in \texttt{base}, the file containing the code for the
% word separators end in \texttt{sep}, and so forth.
%
% \paragraph{Font Driver Files}
% The font driver filenames has been chosen to conform to the
% \texttt{fontname} scheme, as far as possible.
%
% The filename all contain the three characters \texttt{fru}, where,
% according to the the \texttt{fontname} scheme, \texttt{f} stands
% for \textit{public} and \texttt{ru} for \textit{runic}.
%
% Next comes one of the following letters:
% \texttt{c} (\textit{Common Germanic}),
% \texttt{a} (\textit{Anglo-Frisian}),
% \texttt{n} (\textit{Normal}),
% \texttt{t} (\textit{Short-twig}),
% \texttt{l} (\textit{Staveless}) or
% \texttt{m} (\textit{Medieval})
% which represents which of the six rune font families it is.
%
% Then comes another letter, which is one of:
% \texttt{l} (\textit{Light face, without lines}),
% \texttt{m} (\textit{Medium, without lines}),
% \texttt{b} (\textit{Bold face, without lines}),
% \texttt{k} (\textit{Light face, with lines}),
% \texttt{n} (\textit{Medium, with lines}) or
% \texttt{c} (\textit{Bold face, with lines}),
% which represents the series, and with/without alignment lines.
%
% and finally comes one of following:
% \texttt{s} (\textit{Straight twigs, top twig not lowered}),
% \texttt{n} (\textit{Curved twigs, top twig not lowered}),
% \texttt{r} (\textit{Rounded twigs, top twig not lowered}),
% \texttt{t} (\textit{Straight twigs, top twig lowered}),
% \texttt{m} (\textit{Curved twigs, top twig lowered}) or
% \texttt{q} (\textit{Rounded twigs, top twig lowered}),
% which represents two kinds of shape --- the curvature of
% the twigs, and the position of the top twig.
%
% The most reasonable place for the \texttt{fru*.mf} files provided
% with this package is in a directory named\newline
% \indent\meta{mf--source--base--dir}\texttt{/public/allrunes/}.\newline
% This way of naming the font driver files will, if
% \texttt{kpathsea} is in use, put the \texttt{fru*.pk} files in\newline
% \indent\meta{pk--base--dir}\texttt{/public/allrunes/}\newline
% and the \texttt{fru*.tfm} files in\newline
% \indent\meta{tfm--base--dir}\texttt{/public/allrunes/}.
%
% \subsection{The type1 font files}
% The names of the type1 font files (the \texttt{fru*.pfb} files)
% are identical to the corresponding
% \texttt{fru*.mf} files, with just the suffix exchanged.
%
% The most reasonable place for the \texttt{fru*.pfb} files provided
% with this package is in a directory named\newline
% \indent\meta{type1--base--dir}\texttt{/public/allrunes/}.
%
% The type1 font files are generated from the \MF{} font files with
% the program \texttt{mftrace} \cite{Nienhuys}.
%
%
% \paragraph{The map file}
% To be able to use the type1 fonts, programs like \textsf{dvips} and
% \textsf{pdflatex} needs information about which \texttt{*.pfb} file
% a certain fontname corresponds to. This information is normally stored in
% a file \meta{dvips-base-dir}\texttt{/config/psfonts.map},
% but additional information may
% reside in other \texttt{*.map} files. In the \ar{} bundle, a such file called
% \texttt{allrunes.map} is supplied. There are several reasonable places for
% it, but \meta{dvips-base-dir}\texttt{/allrunes} would be fine.
%
% In recent versions of (at least) the MiKTeX- and teTeX-implementations, the
% handling of \texttt{*.map} files is rather simple. Look in the directory
% \meta{tex-base-dir}\texttt{/web2c/}. If there is a file called \texttt{updmap.cfg},
% open it for editing and add a line:\newline
% \indent\texttt{MixedMap allrunes.map}\newline
% (if you have both the \MF{} files and the type1 files installed), or\newline
% \indent\texttt{Map allrunes.map}\newline
% (if you only have the type1 files installed)
% in some suitable place. Then update the other \texttt{*.map} files by running the command:\newline
% \indent\texttt{initexmf -v --mkmap}\newline
% if you are using MiKTeX. If you are using teTeX, use the command:\newline
% \indent\texttt{updmap}\newline
%
% Older versions requires more work:
% edit the file \meta{dvips-base-dir}\texttt{/config/config.ps}, in which a line:\newline
% \indent\texttt{p +allrunes.map}\newline
% should be inserted somewhere \textit{after} the line:\newline
% \indent\texttt{p psfonts.map}\newline
% In a similar way, to make \textsf{pdflatex} find the \texttt{allrunes.map},
% insert a line:\newline
% \indent\texttt{map +allrunes.map}\newline
% somewhere \textit{after} the line:\newline
% \indent\texttt{map psfonts.map}.\newline
% in the file \meta{pdftex-base-dir}\texttt{/config/pdftex.cfg}.
%
% \section{The \LaTeX{} files}
%
% To follow the scheme of the \MF{} files, it would be appropriate to
% place all \LaTeX{} files, namely the \texttt{ar?.fd} and the
% \texttt{allrunes.sty} files, in\newline
% \indent\meta{tex-base-dir}\texttt{/tex/latex/allrunes/}.
%
% \subsection{The \LaTeX\ and \NFSS\ Support}
%
% To use the \ar{} fonts with \LaTeX; load
% the \ar{} package with the command
% \begin{quote}
%   \verb|\usepackage{allrunes}|
% \end{quote}
% in the preamble of the document. 
%
% \subsection{Font Selection Commands}
%
%
% None of the font families is
% activated as default font, since the runes hardly ever will be used
% as the main font throughout an entire document. The commands and their
% corresponding declarations, together with some examples of the resulting
% output are:\\[2mm]
% \begin{tabular}{llll}
%   \verb|\textarc{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\arcfamily| &
%     \emph{Common Germanic} runes &   \textarc{fu\th arkgwh} \\
%   \verb|\textara{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\arafamily| &
%     \emph{Anglo-Frisian} runes &  \textara{fu\th orcgwh} \\
%   \verb|\textarn{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\arnfamily| &
%     \emph{normal} runes & \textarn{\fu} \\
%   \verb|\textart{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\artfamily| &
%     \emph{short-twig} runes & \textart{\fu} \\
%   \verb|\textarl{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\arlfamily| &
%     \emph{staveless} runes &  \textarl{\withlines\fu} \\
%   \verb|\textarm{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\armfamily| &
%     \emph{medieval} runes & \textarm{abcdefghi}\\
% \end{tabular}\\[2mm]
%
% \subsection{Shape and Series Selection Commands}
%
% Within each font family there is the opportunity to
% choose among a lot of varieties with
% the commands and declarations below. Note that almost all of
% those commands and declarations
% only has meaning for the rune font families in the \ar{} package.
% The exceptions are the two commands and declarations
% for selecting bold or medium text, which are standard \LaTeX.
%
% \noindent
% First there is the series: bold, medium or light (medium is default)\\[2mm]
% \begin{tabular}{lll}
%   \verb|\textbf{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\bfseries| & \textarn{\textbf{\fu}}\\
%   \verb|\textmd{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\mdseries| & \textarn{\textmd{\fu}}\\
%   \verb|\textlf{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\lfseries| & \textarn{\textlf{\fu}}\\
% \end{tabular}\\[2mm]
% Then there is the choice whether to have alignment lines or not (without is default):\\[2mm]
% \begin{tabular}{lll}
%   \verb|\textwil{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\withlines|    & \textarn{\textwil{\fu}}\\
%   \verb|\textwol{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\withoutlines| & \textarn{\textwol{\fu}}\\
% \end{tabular}\\[2mm]
% Another parameter to vary is the curvature of the twigs (curved is default). This
% parameter has a slightly different meaning for the staveless runes.\\[2mm]
% \begin{tabular}{llll}
%   \verb|\textst{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\straighttwigs| & \textarn{\textst{\fu}} & \textarl{\textwil{\textst{\fu}}} \\
%   \verb|\textcu{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\curvedtwigs|   & \textarn{\textcu{\fu}} & \textarl{\textwil{\textcu{\fu}}} \\
%   \verb|\textro{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\roundedtwigs|  & \textarn{\textro{\fu}} & \textarl{\textwil{\textro{\fu}}} \\
% \end{tabular}\\[2mm]
% For those runes that have a joint in the top, there is also an opportunity to
% chose whether it should
% be in the absolute top position (high twigs) or lowered a little (low twigs). The
% default is high twigs. This
% parameter has a slightly different meaning for the staveless runes.\\[2mm]
% \begin{tabular}{llll}
%   \verb|\texthi{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\hightwigs| & \textarn{\texthi{\fu}} & \textarl{\textwil{\texthi{\fu}}} \\
%   \verb|\textlo{|\textit{text}\verb|}| & \verb|\lowtwigs|  & \textarn{\textlo{\fu}} & \textarl{\textwil{\textlo{\fu}}} \\
% \end{tabular}\\[2mm]
%
% Since in inscriptions, the runes sometimes (mainly in inscriptions with the Common Germanic
% runes) were written in
% just about any direction, there are commands for reversing them and to turn them round:\\[2mm]
% \begin{tabular}{lll}
%   \verb|\hflip{|\textit{rune}\verb|}| & \textarc{\hflip{f}}\\
%   \verb|\vflip{|\textit{rune}\verb|}| & \textarc{\vflip{f}}\\
%   \verb|\turn{|\textit{rune}\verb|}|  & \textarc{\turn{f}}\\
% \end{tabular}\\[2mm]
% Note that those three commands only take \textit{one} rune as argument.
%
% \subsection{Sizes}
% The \ar{} package honors all \LaTeX\ standard size changing commands. When
% using the \MF{} fonts, the standard sizes of \LaTeX: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10.95,
% 12, 14.4, 17.28, 20.74, 24.88, 29.86 and 35.83 pt are available.
%
%
% \section{On runological design decisions}
% The purpose of this package is to make it possible writing a scientific
% paper or book about runes or runic inscriptions using \LaTeX. Since there exist
% no suitable official standard for runes, as far as the author knows\footnote{The
% Unicode Standard (see \cite{Unicode} on runes), is not enough for this purpose. F.x. are the
% staveless runes missing.} a few decisions, concerning the selection of runes, have to been made.
% Of course you can look up runes in any encyclopedia and copy them. But
% runes did appear in many varieties, and in order to fulfill the
% purpose above, you have to cover, preferably all, but at least a great deal of them. The
% original runes were cut or carved by individuals who probably didn't learn about
% runes in the same school. Therefore there is a more or less continuous
% variation in shape of the runes. You then
% have to decide on, when to consider
% these variations as just deviations from the main form, and when to consider
% them as a distinct form. With this in mind, I have formulated
% three possible, and rather different, principles for the design:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Standard. Find all clearly distinguishable forms and skip all
%   finer variants. Design the runes similar to the ones used in most
%   literature on runes.
% \item Art. Be inspired of all original rune inscriptions and design
%   typographically consistent runic font families, possibly in
%   several different forms.
% \item Copy. Try to catch as many of all the existing varieties in
%   the original rune inscriptions without worrying to much about
%   consistent typography.
% \end{itemize}
% This resulting package --- \ar{} --- is of course a compromise
% between all three of the principles above:
%
% First there is a font family for each of the six main type of runes
% used: Common Germanic,
% Anglo-Frisian, normal (Scandinavian),
% short-twig (Scandinavian), staveless (Scandinavian), medieval (Scandinavian).
% For each font family there is a
% default shape/serie that is essentially identical to the most common
% types. Then there exist a few
% different shapes/series: bold/medium/light, with lines/without lines,
% straight/normal/rounded twigs and normal/\-lowered top twig, each of which is typographically
% consistent. (Which might result in some few runes that never have occurred in real
% inscriptions.) Within each font family all clearly distinguishable
% forms are defined, and together with all the typographical varieties
% $(6*3*2*3*2=216)$ this mimics really a lot of the existing varieties.
%
% \subsection{The font families}
% The partitioning of the runes in six main types is of course not
% undisputable. Having just one font family with all runes would have
% some definite advantages, i.e.\ runic characters that always had the
% same appearance wouldn't need to be duplicated. On the other hand, runic
% characters that did change their appearance through time and space would
% need rather cumbersome names to be called upon with. So, how to partition
% then? The distinction between the older futhark with 24 characters, and the
% younger (Scandinavian) with 16, is obvious. Also, the younger futhark have three well
% recognized subfutharks, the normal, the short-twig, and the staveless futhark \cite{Jansson}.
% The runes from England and Frisia, stands out from the main older futhark, with a
% few extra runes, 28 or 33 all in all, as another obvious partition \cite{Page}. That's the
% five easy ones.
%
% In Scandinavia the runes continued to thrive and develop well into the
% medieval period. The normal runes were
% complemented, not with new runes (well only very few, and not commonly recognized),
% but mostly with ''dotted'' runes. In the 12th century there were runes for all Scandinavian
% letters, around 29 ones, but the futhark were still considered to contain only 16 characters!
% Today, most runologists therefore set up an anachronistic alphabet with both dotted and un-dotted
% runes. Unfortunately there were some diversification. Some runes appeared
% only in Greenland, Iceland, Orkney, or Gotland --- and in the isolated province of Dalarna
% in Sweden a mix of runes and Latin
% letters developed, where it was in use into the 19th century. Five more medieval runic
% alphabets? Or
% one medieval runic alphabet containing several runes that never occurred together? I chose
% the later one, but excluded the runes from Dalarna. That makes six.
%
% When looking at the older futhark in close detail one can find
% a lot of different forms: the Scandinavian-Gothic 175-400,
% the Scandinavian 400-750, the Continental 400-750,
% the Frisian 400-750, the Anglo-Saxon
% 400-650 and the Anglo-Saxon 650-1100 \cite{Odenstedt}, \cite{Parsons99}.
% Here at least two font families are needed, one for the main one, and one for the
% Anglo-Frisian. But where to draw the line? The Frisian runes are closer to
% the main ones than to the late English, but they also share some very characteristic
% runes, not found elsewhere. Similar questions arise for the Continental and Scandinavian
% runes. When comparing the different rune forms listed in \cite{Odenstedt}, I have decided
% to just have the two obvious ones: Common Germanic (i.e. the Continental
% 400-750, Scandinavian-Gothic 175-400 and Scandinavian 400-750) and the
% Anglo-Frisian (Frisian 400-750, Anglo-Saxon 400-650 and Anglo-Saxon 650-1100).
% That makes six font families. I welcome comments.
%
% \subsection{Excluded runes}
% As mentioned above, the mix of medieval runes and Latin letters used in the province
% of Dalarna in Sweden, is not covered here.
%
% Cryptic or secret runes, f.x.\ like the different cipher runes on the
% stone from R\"ok in Sweden, is not covered. This might change in
% future releases.
%
% Magic runes is another category of runes. They are mostly varieties from the older
% futhark, with some features of a rune
% occurring several times, like the ''fir-tree'' on the stone from Kylver, which can
% be interpreted as a \textarn{t}-rune with its branches six times repeated.
% None of those are so far included, but might be in future releases.
%
% Both in inscriptions with the older futhark, and in medieval ones, there are bind-runes or ligatures,
% mostly in the form of two runes sharing the same main stem. Since there exist really
% many combinations, I do not try to cover those. An alternative would of course be to
% cover only those actually occurring in inscriptions.
%
% Finally, there exists several unique runes, known only from one inscription each. Some
% are included in the \ar{} package, mainly those who ''fit'' into the system,
% and where the uniqueness probably is due to the sparse number of preserved inscriptions.
% Runes whose uniqueness are due to apparently clumsy or ignorant carvers are most deliberately
% excluded from the \ar{} package.
% In many cases it is hard to decide in which of the two above categories a certain rune belongs to.
% I might however include some more of those unique runes in future releases.
%
%
% \section{Bugs and shortcomings}
% In addition to all the for me unknown bugs and shortcomings, there are
% the following known:
%
% I have not looked at all the runes in all the 216
% different forms in different sizes. Some might look less nice, due to
% errors in the parameterizations. Please tell me if you encounter any.
%
% The \verb|\vflip{}|, \verb|\hflip{}| and the \verb|\turn{}| command
% can not be used together with commands like
% \verb|\.| and \verb|\=|. To produce f.x.\ \textarn{\hflip{g}} you have to
% write \verb+\hflip{g}+, \textit{not} \verb+\hflip{\.k}+. (That's the reason
% why all the ''dotted'' runes have alternative names.) Probably it can be
% fixed if you use \verb+\DeclareTextComand+ instead of
% \verb|\DeclareTextComposite| (see~\cite{LaTeXfCPW}), but
% I didn't really figure out how to do it.
% Please tell me if you find a reasonable way to handle this.
%
% Perhaps a (virtual) font is needed for the transliteration. A few characters
% that are needed are not present in the European modern boldface sans serif font,
% like the {\ts\sharpi} and a
% suitable uppercase \ts{\footnotesize R}.
%
% I have now supplied kerning information for all
% the rune font families, but only (almost) for the non-flipped
% versions. There are simply to many combinations otherwise.
% As an example of what impact
% the kerning has, compare:\\
% \textarn{filaka:krimR} (with kerning) with:\\
% \textarn{f\mbox{}i\mbox{}l\mbox{}a\mbox{}k\mbox{}a\mbox{}:%
% \mbox{}k\mbox{}r\mbox{}i\mbox{}m\mbox{}R} (without kerning).\\
% The kerning is set for the default forms, and is by no means
% adjusted for the other forms. This should only result in
% displeasing appearances in very few cases, but they need nevertheless to
% be taken care of (and to be found).
%
% It would be nice to be able to letterspace runes, f.x.\ with the \package{soul}
% package. Unfortunately the \ar{} and the \package{soul} package does not
% work at all together.
%
% Since the same source is used for all fonts, in all sizes, there is no
% adaptation for discretization problems. Therefore you should not expect
% fine results on printers with resolution less than 1200~dpi. I find
% the 12~pt fonts acceptable at 600~dpi, but not the 10~pt ones.
%
% I have cheated to get nonlinear scaling of the fonts. You will therefore sometimes get the
% ''Checksum mismatch'' error when generating the pk-files, but that will
% not cause any problems, as far as I know. When I understand how the driver
% files for the ec font are generated I'll do something similar for the allrunes
% fonts instead.
%
% The type1 fonts are generated from the \MF{} files with the program \texttt{mftrace} \cite{Nienhuys}.

%
% In Pforzen, Bayern, Germany, a silver belt buckle was found with the following
% inscription:
% \begin{quotation}
% \noindent
% {\arcfamily  \large
% .aigil.andi.aIlrun\\
% l.ta\h u:ga\sthree o\vflip{\k}un.}
% \end{quotation}
%
% In M\"ojbro, Uppland, Sweden, a stone with an inscription and a
% picture was found. The inscription is written from right to
% left and from bottom to top:
% \begin{quotation}
% \noindent
% {\arcfamily  \large
% R\\
% \hflip{a}\hflip{n}ig\hflip{a}\hflip{l}\hflip{\sthree}i\hflip{a}\hflip{h}

% }
% \end{quotation}
%
% In Torna H\"allestad, Sk\r ane, Sweden, three rune stones are set up
% in the wall of the church. The longest inscription of the three reads as
% follows:
% \begin{quotation}
% \noindent
% {\arnfamily  \large

%
% In England, now at the British Museum, the stone cross from Lancaster
% has the following runic inscription:
% \begin{quotation}
% \noindent
% {\arafamily  \large
% gibi\d\ae\th fo\\
% r\ae cynibal\\
% \th cu\th bere}
% \end{quotation}
%
% In H\"og, H\"arjedalen, Sweden, a stone has an inscription made with staveless
% runes:
% \begin{quotation}

% \end{quotation}
%
% On the font (a real font, a baptismal font) in the church of Burseryd, Gotland, Sweden,
% medieval runes are used. Except for the bind-runes, which are resolved here and
% shown as individual characters, the inscription looks like:
% \begin{quotation}

% \section{Tables for all the runic characters}
% On the following pages tables with all the runic characters
% in all the font families of the \ar{} font are listed, together with the most

% \noindent The runic writing system had no real punctuation marks,
% but word separator symbols. To make it simple, all of the symbols
% in the table above are
% part of all the six rune font families, listed below.
%
% I have used
% the \texttt{*} to produce the symbol \rn{*} instead of \rn{\star}, which
% of course had been more
% consequent. This is because I want to be able to access it, as being one of
% the most common word separators (together with the \rn{:}), as a
% single character.

%
% \noindent The main source for the runic characters is \cite{Odenstedt}.
%
% Note that the two main forms of the h-rune were not used together.
% The rune \rc{h} was used in Scandinavia, and the rune \rc{\h} was used on the
% Continent.
%
% Some of the variant forms have uncertain interpretations. I have chosen just one of
% the proposed ones. F.x. the \rc{\Ing} might be a double \rc{w} (w) or a ligature
% of \rc{i} (i) and \rc{\ng} (\ng), the \rc{\ING} might be a double \rc{\th} (\th) or a ligature
% of \rc{i} (i) and \rc{\ng} (\ng), and the \rc{D} might be a peculiar \rc{d} (d) or
% a big \rc{\NG} (\ng). See \cite{Odenstedt} for an overview of the arguments.
%
% Of the several
% zig-zag forms of the s-rune, only a few have occurred in inscriptions,
% but for the sake of symmetry, forms with all number of strokes from three
% to eight are included.
%
% The two runes in the last section are from the stone from R\"ok, from the part of the
% inscription written with common Germanic runes. They have been put
% in a separate section here, since being anachronistic, they do not
% really belong to the common Germanic runes.

% \noindent The main sources for the runic characters are \cite{Odenstedt}, \cite{Page} and \cite{Parsons99}.
%
% The table is divided in three sections. First comes the 28 ''real'' runes.
% Of the several
% zig-zag forms of the s-rune, only a few have occurred in inscriptions,
% but for the sake of symmetry, forms with all number of strokes from three
% to eight are included.
% The \ra{P} rune occurs, as far as I know,
% only on the Westeremden B inscription, see~\cite{Quak}, p.~84-85. There are some other strange runes
% in this inscription that I also might include.
%
% In the second section some runes are listed
% that never seem to have been part of the futhorc, nevertheless are known from ''real''
% inscriptions. The symbol \ra{\rex} only occurs on coins, and does not seem to be a widely
% accepted rune; it is described in
% \cite{Parsons99},~p.~84-85. In the last section, two (three) late Anglo-Saxon ''pseudo runes''
% have been listed. They have, as far as I know,
% never been used for ''real'' writing, but occur only in late manuscript futhorcs; probably
% as a product of runic antiquarians. Often a rune \ra{j} called \ts{ior} is taken to this group.
% I consider it equal to the main variant of \ts{j}. For these ''pseudo runes'',
% \cite{Parsons94} provided most of the information.
%
%
% When transliterating the runes there are several systems to choose from. I have used what I think is
% most common practice, bold sans serif, for all kinds of runes, even for the
% Anglo-Saxon runes. I'm however well aware of the the
% Dickins-Page system, with letterspaced medium roman characters within single
% quotes, which is preferred by at least some British runologists.
% More on this can be found in \cite{Derolez}. Compare \ts{\t eadric} with 'ea d r i c', for \ra{\ea dric}.

% This font covers the staveless runes known mainly from H\"alsingland, Sweden. Other
% staveless runes occurred in S\"odermanland, Sweden; they are not covered here.
%
% The rune for \ts{\k{a}} has never been found
% in a typical inscription. Its assumed appearance, \rl{A},
% is based upon the symmetry considerations, and is a rather widely accepted guess.
% However, in a late Norwegian inscription, the form \rl{\A} was used, p.~244 in~\cite{Peterson94}.
%
% The height of the \rl{f}, \rl{k}, \rl{h} and \rl{s} runes could vary quite a lot;
% here only some kind of average form is used.

% \noindent The main source for the medieval runic characters is \cite{Runmarkt}, with support
% from \cite{DRI}, \cite{Enoksen}, \cite{Jansson}, \cite{Moltke} and \cite{Haugen} (despite the
% claim in the later of ''ikke m oppfattatast som nokon autoritativ katalog''). Finally, the
% rune \textarm{\"\P} from Schleswig, is from \cite{Spurkland} and the rune \textarm{\.r} is
% from \cite{Larsson}.
%
% The table is divided in three sections. First come the ''real'' runes, as an alphabet, not
% as an futhark. Next, the three bind-runes that always occurred in rune
% staves (runic calendars) are listed. Finally come two runes used by, and invented by, a modern
% Swedish rune carver, Kalle Dahlgren, \cite{Dahlgren} to make it possible to use runes for writing
% in the Swedish language of today. I put them here because modern swedish rune carvers essentially use
% the medieval runes ---
% complemented with these two. However, Kalle Dahlgren has changed his
% mind, and now uses the \rm{\adot} rune instead of the \rm{\aa} for the letter \r a.
%
% Note that the runic symbols for c, s and z respectively, were to an large extent
% interchangeable. In the table above they are however not duplicated.

%
% This section describes the driver files
% \texttt{fru}\meta{family}\meta{series}\meta{shape}\texttt{.mf}, where
% \meta{family} is one of
% \texttt{c} (Common Germanic),
% \texttt{a} (Anglo-Saxon),
% \texttt{n} (normal),
% \texttt{t} (short-twig),
% \texttt{l} (staveless) and
% \texttt{m} (medieval).
% \meta{series} is one of
% \texttt{m} (medium, withoutlines),
% \texttt{b} (boldface, withoutlines),
% \texttt{l} (lightface, withoutlines),
% \texttt{n} (medium, withlines),
% \texttt{c} (boldface, withlines) and
% \texttt{k} (lightface, withlines).
% \meta{shape} is one of
% \texttt{n} (curved, hightwigs),
% \texttt{s} (straight, hightwigs),
% \texttt{r} (rounded, hightwigs),
% \texttt{m} (curved, lowtwigs),
% \texttt{t} (straight, lowtwigs) and
% \texttt{q} (rounded, lowtwigs).
%
% First we declare some common variables determining the
% shape of the font.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
string boldness;
boolean withlines;
string barshape;
boolean loweredbars;

%    \end{macrocode}
% Next the variables have their values set. (Note that the beginning
% of the lines: <something> of course not shows up in the \MF file.)
% One line from these three:
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<medium>boldness="medium";
%<bold>boldness="bold";
%<light>boldness="light";
%    \end{macrocode}
% and one line from these two:
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<withoutlines>withlines=false;
%<withlines>withlines=true;
%    \end{macrocode}
% and one line from these three:
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<straight>barshape="straight";
%<curved>barshape="curved";
%<rounded>barshape="rounded";
%    \end{macrocode}
% and finally one line from these two:
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<hightwigs>loweredbars=false;
%<lowtwigs>loweredbars=true;
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% Then the basefile is loaded, with all the heavy stuff.
% And the code for the word separator symbols are
% loaded. Common to all font families.
%    \begin{macrocode}

input frubase;
input frusep;
%    \end{macrocode}
% And then the source files
% specific for the current font family is input.
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<frucin>input fruc;
%<fruain>input frua;
%<frunin>input frun;
%<frutin>input frut;
%<frulin>input frul;
%<frumin>input frum;
