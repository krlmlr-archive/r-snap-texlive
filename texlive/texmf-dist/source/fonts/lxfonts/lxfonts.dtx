% This self extracting documented file |lxfonts.dtx|, besides the |lxfonts.sty|
% file,  produces the font description files necessary to use the LX fonts
% in any document, specifically presentations, but not only. It documents
% why they were made and the choices made in selecting which fonts to convert
% to this style.
%
% These fonts should be useful for typesetting documents with T1 encoding (OT1
% is also supported) and blends text and math fonts in the proper way; AMS fonts
% are  supported. For legacy reasons the \LaTeX\ special symbol set is also
% accordingly restyled. 
%
% \section{The LX fonts}
% In the first eighties, when \LaTeX\ was conceived, Leslie Lamport  created
% a stand alone program, or better, a mark-up \SliTeX\ format that
% could be used in place of \LaTeX\ when it was necessary to create transparencies
% for conferences, lectures, and presentations; when \LaTeXe\ was made available
% in the early nineties, that set of mark-up macros and format did not exist
% any more, and in its place there was the new class \pack{slides}.
%
% The processing of the source files was almost identical, although the new
% class \pack{slides} had more typesetting power thanks to the \LaTeXe\ more
% powerful macros.
% 
% Both processes produced printed documents that could be photocopied onto
% methacrylate transparencies and used with overhead projectors.
%
% Since the advent of beamer projectors, that can operate directly from a
% computer, and the availability of the \prog{pdfLaTeX} typesetting program,
% a set of packages was made available to the \TeX\ community so as to
% produce wonderful presentations, possibly together with their 
% printed handouts, that quickly replaced the old and honorable \SliTeX\ 
% format and the \pack{slides} class.
% 
% The fonts that Leslie Lamport had devised to use with \SliTeX\ and
% \pack{slides} had a great advantage over the default \TeX\ system fonts,
% namely the traditional Computer Modern ones, and, after the introduction
% of the  new encoding T1, of the European Computer fonts and, later on,
% of the Latin Modern vector fonts.
%
% It was \emph{legibility}.
%
% This advantage was obtained from the sans serif quotation fonts designed
% by D.E.~Knuth himself; he used them to typeset the witty quotations at each 
% chapter end of both his \TeX\ and \MF\ books.
%
% But these Knuthian fonts had a disadvantage: the capital `I' and the lower
% case `l' were hardly distinguishable from one another and from the absolute
% value vertical bar. Leslie Lamport solved in part this problem by changing
% the sans serif `I' with a serifed one; this was fine most of the time, but
% did not solve the similarity of the sans serif lower case `l' with the math
% absolute value bar.
%
% Moreover when typesetting math in those old fashioned slides, only the
% |operators| font was changed to a sans serif one, while the |letters| math
% italics font, together with the other |symbols| normal and |largesymbols| large
% symbol fonts remained the same; the result was that some math glyphs
% obtained by juxtaposition of symbols coming from the operator font and
% some other math font, resulted clearly inadequate.
%
% The solution of such problems consisted in redesigning the shape of the lower
% case `l', so as to be more similar to an upright italic one, with a curved
% bottom, and to restyle all the math fonts with the same graphic font settings
% of the Lamport fonts, both in OT1 and T1 encoding, and in the math encodings
% OML, OMS OMX, plus the Text Companion TS1 encoded fonts, the \AMS\ fonts and
% the \LaTeX\ symbol fonts.
% 
% This is all what concerns these extended slide LX fonts; while doing this
% extensions I had to change the metadescription of several glyphs, but the
% overall work was not that complicated; it was just heavy because the large
% number of fonts involved, and therefore the overall glyph number.
% 
% This package redefines both the text and math font families; checks if
% the \AMS\ fonts have been called for, avoids to redefine the nice glyphs of
% the \AMS\ collection with the \LaTeX\ symbol fonts, although it will
% redefine the latter ones in case the user wants to use them, but did not
% load the \AMS\ font collections.
%
% These settings are deferred at begin document time, so that the necessary
% checks may be used after other fonts are possibly loaded.
%
% As a bonus the typewriter fonts are loaded in a scaled up version so that
% their x-height matches the larger LX fonts. Such fonts are scaled 25\%
% up so that the 8pt design size typewriter font x-height matches
% the corresponding height of the LX fonts.
%
% These LX fonts are available in both vector and bitmapped form; I made the
% whole work by working on the \MF\ source files; when I was satisfied with
% the bitmapped fonts produced with \MF, I traced them by means of the
% \prog{mftrace} program, by Han-Wen NienÂ­huys, and produced the .pfb files
% containing the vector description of the glyphs. In order to use them
% with \prog{pdfLaTeX} it is necessary to have available the .map file,
% that I provided as part of this package. As a consequence of the method
% I followed, this bundle contains also the .tfm metric information
%
% \section{Usage}
% The only action needed to use these LX fonts is to call 
%\begin{verbatim}
%\usepackage{lxfonts}
%\end{verbatim}
% in the preamble; there are no options to set.
%
% If you use \pack{beamer} to create your presentation you might need to specify
%\begin{verbatim}
%\usefonttheme{professionalfonts}
%\end{verbatim}
% in order to avoid that beamer resets some math fonts the way it defaults to;
% for the rest you don't need to follow a particular loading order, although it
% might be clearer if you loaded your fonts after specifying the input and 
% font encoding(s).
%
% \section{Standalone usage of the LX fonts}\label{sec:standalone}
%
% The style file \texttt{lxfonts.sty} changes all the default font settings
% so that you cannot use any other font together with the LX ones.
%
% You can circumvent this rigidity by using the explicit declaration of the
% font family you want to use; for example, if you called this package and at a
% certain point you want to typeset something with a serifed font, say, the
% T1 encoded Latin Modern roman font, you can define a macro declaration or
% explicitly specify:
%\begin{verbatim}
%{\usefont{T1}{lmr}{m}{n} Words\ldots words}
%\end{verbatim}
% By so doing the ``Words\ldots words'' will be typeset in roman medium Latin
% Modern T1 encoded font at the current size
%
% On the opposite if you want to show a sample text written with the LX fonts while
% you are typesetting with other fonts, you don't use the above .sty file package,
% but use a macro declaration or the explicit command:
%\begin{verbatim}
%{\usefont{T1}{llcmss}{m}{n} Words\ldots words}
%\end{verbatim}
% and you get {\usefont{T1}{llcmss}{m}{n} Words\dots words} at the current type
% size; notice though, how larger the script appears thanks to the larger x-height,
% but uppercase letters are the same size as the serifed ones.
%
% With version 1.0 of this package, this functionality was not possible.
%
% \section{Integration of the  Latin and  the Greek scripts}  
% The Greek CB fonts contain also the  families and shapes for slides;
% the style is the same as these LX fonts, but the different script does
% not require any restyling of any glyph; so they can be used directly;
% but the script changing mechanism simply implies the change of the
% encoding; therefore in order to  use the above Greek CB fonts, it is
% simply necessary to have available new font description files whose
% name is the agglutination of the Greek encoding name  (in lower case)
% with the family name (identical to that of the Latin script); the contents
% of such files, of course, retrieves the glyphs from the Greek fonts files.
%
% Therefore it should not be difficult in a presentation to specify the Greek
% language in the preamble of the source file, and use the \pack{babel} language
% switching commands to as to write something like this:
% {\usefont{LGR}{llcmss}{m}{n} Kal'' hm'era!} means \emph{Good day!}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
%
% \section{ The LX fonts demo presentation}
% This bundle, besides this documentation, is shipped with a demo presentation
% where most features of the LX fonts are shown; the slides clearly show the
% features of these fonts, both the positive  and negative ones.  The
% \emph{legibility}, in my opinion, is excellent; if it was not for this
% point I would not have undertaken the work of restyling all these fonts.
% But there ale also some little glitches that are partly inherent to the
% chosen one-size continuously scalable font. Moreover the Greek fonts,
% which are not part in themselves of my LX project, requires some
% adjustments in several kerning values, but at the moment it is acceptable,
% even if its kerning is not perfect. 
% 
% While typesetting math it is clearly noticeable the lack of optical sizes:
% the super and subscripts appear definitely of the right size, but their
% scaling makes them appear lighter than they should be; this is common with
% all fonts that come in one size only, and this happens with the majority
% of the Type~1 fonts distributed with the \TeX\ system.
%
% The Greek font kerning  adjustment is on my TODO list.
%
% \section{Acknowledgemts}
% I would like to thank all the users who appreciated these fonts and
% gave me some feedback remarking some glitches; in particular I would
% like to acknowledge the interaction with G\"unter Milde, who gave me
% precious suggestions, among which that of detaching the font description
% files form the |lxfonts.sty| file.
%
% \StopEventually{}^^A This macro argument can be a bibliography, for example.
%
% \section{Documented code}
% \subsection{The package code}
% The settings relative to the LX fonts are deferred to the |\AtEndPreamble|
% hook (defined by package |etoolbox|) so that any previous font setting is
% replaced by the ones relative to the LX fonts; this is particularly useful
% when preparing source files for a presentation; in this way all the fonts
% connected to the the slide show will be homogeneously styled the same way.

% Of course this is not a serious drawback in other situations, since I have
% shown in section~\ref{sec:standalone} what to do in order to overcome this
% apparent limitation.
% 
% First I test if certain packages have been loaded, specifically packages
% \pack{latexsym} and \pack{amsfonts}; if so, certain switches are set |true|.
% At the proper point these switches will be used in order to load or to avoid
% to load certain font description files that will supersede the ones called
% by such named packages.
%
% At the same time the text and math defaults are set or reset so as to use only
% the LX fonts.

% necessary to typeset a foreign name or to typeset some phrases or paragraphs
% in an ancient version of the same language and diacritics pop up again.

% fonts, but this is out of topic since these LX fonts can be used only
% by \prog{pdfLaTeX}, that cannot directly handle OpenType fonts.

% \subsection {The \AMS\ fonts}
% Since the \AMS\ fonts are used so often, either directly or through
% the \pack{amssymb} package, I restyled both families |msam| and |msbm|.
% In the .sty file I kept the math group names the same so that the symbol
% definitions keep making reference to the same encoding and slot positions,
% but they take the glyphs from different files.
%
% In both cases the |\DeclareFontFamily| statement appears to be unnecessary
% because these font description files are loaded only if the \pack{amsfonts}
% package has been called. But we have seen above that these font description
% files are reloaded at the |\AtEndPreamble| hook; moreover if these fonts are
% used as standalone ones, the declaration is absolutely necessary.

% \subsection{The Greek font for slides}
% The CB Greek font collection contains also the family and shape of the slides
% fonts; of course with the Greek script there is no problem with possible
% confusions of capital `I' and lower case `l', therefore they did not need
% any restyling. The only question related to Greek fonts is that the same
% font family names for the Latin Script must be associated with the Greek
% script with the Greek encoding LGR, instead of the Latin encoding T1. The
% Greek font description files, therefore, have a different prefix (LGR),
% the same family name (llcmss for proportional sans serif fonts, or lcmtt
% for monospaced ones), but the glyphs are taken from the relevant Greek fonts.

%\subsection{The map file}

% reconfiguration is done by the system installation macros and the
% user should not play around with such delicate questions; it must be
% remarked also that the methods for reconfiguring that file
% are being updated in a significant way in certain distribution
% of the \TeX\ system, and it would be very dangerous to describe the
% 2013 procedure, when it possible that in 2014 it is a different one.
% In any case the user who really needs to install these fonts ``by hand''
% is advised to read the documentation of his/her current distribution
% of the \TeX\ system so as to perform  the update map correct configuration
% procedure.
