  The remainder of this report consists of appendices, whose contents ought
  to be described briefly here:
  
! Appendix A explains in detail how to carry out a test of \MF, given
  a tape that contains copies of the other appendices.
  
! Appendix B is \.{TRAP.MF}, the fiendish test file that has already
  been mentioned. People who think that they understand \MF\ are challenged
  to see if they know what \MF\ is supposed to do with this file.
  People who know only a little about \MF\ might still find it
  interesting to study Appendix~B, just to get some insights into the
  methodology advocated here.
  
! Appendix C is \.{TRAPIN.LOG}, a correct transcript file \.{TRAP.LOG}
  that results if \.{INIMF} is applied to \.{TRAP.MF}. (\.{INIMF} is
  the name of a version of \MF\ that does certain initializations;
  this run of \.{INIMF} also creates a binary base file called \.{TRAP.BASE}.)
  
! Appendix D is a correct transcript file \.{TRAP.LOG} that results if
  \.{INIMF} or any other version of \MF\ is applied to \.{TRAP.MF}
  with base file \.{TRAP.BASE}.
  
! Appendix E is \.{TRAP.TYP}, the symbolic version of a correct output
  file \.{TRAP.72270GF} that was produced at the same time as the \.{TRAP.LOG}
  file of Appendix~D.
  
! Appendix F is \.{TRAP.PL}, the symbolic version of a correct output
  file \.{TRAP.TFM} that was produced at the same time as the \.{TRAP.LOG}
  file of Appendix~D.
  
! Appendix G is \.{TRAP.FOT}, an abbreviated version of Appendix D that
  appears on the user's terminal during the run that produces \.{TRAP.LOG},
  \.{TRAP.72270GF}, and \.{TRAP.TFM}.
