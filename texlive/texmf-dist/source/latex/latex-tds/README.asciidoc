                modules containing TDS-compliant trees for items of the +
                LaTeX distribution (both the base system and required packages), +
                together with `user-friendly' documentation (PDF +
                files with navigation support using bookmarks and links).

How it has started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The project started as I wanted to install the new LaTeX release 2005/12/01
that was announced at 2006/04/27. However the files are not packed in
TDS format, ready for unpacking in the destination directory. And
the documentation files were not yet generated or the provided
PDF files are lacking of basic features such as bookmarks or link support.
Thus this project has started. I thought it could be finished during
the afternoon at the day of the announcement ...

Goals of the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* From the sources a TDS compliant tree is constructed and populated.
  The zipped result is distributed.
* All the documentation is generated from the sources. The PDF files
  are user friendly and provide navigational support with bookmarks
  and links.
* The PDF files are post-processed to reduce the file size.

Scope
~~~~~
I do not have the time to assemble a TeX distribution with
thousands of packages. Therefore I restricted myself to the
LaTeX base distribution and the required bundles.
In the following I will use the term `module' for a package bundle.

Installation Hints
------------------

Hopefully the result of this project helps you in the installation
process. You get a TDS compliant tree just by unpacking.

Example:
----
  cd /some/where/texmf
  unzip latex-tds
----
or unzip's option +-d+:
----
  unzip latex-tds -d /some/where/texmf
----

Instead of the universe ZIP file single modules can be selected.

Important to remember, point your unpack process right in
the root directory of your TDS tree. The directory structure
in the ZIP files start with the top-level directories:
----
  doc/latex/base/...
  tex/latex/tools/...
  source/...
----
Rationale: The root directory of a TDS tree can have different
names, such as texmf-dist, texmf-local, ...

Hints
~~~~~
--
* Refresh the file name database.
* Be aware that unpacking can insert and update files, but never
  deletes obsolete ones. Remainders of previous releases can
  cause trouble.
* Depending on the module further installation steps can be
  necessary, consult the module's own documentation.
--

Module base
^^^^^^^^^^^
  * The default +texsys.cfg+ that LaTeX provides is put
    into +TDS:tex/latex/base+. It must be removed, if you need
    a specialized version. Consult your TeX distribution
    and +TDS:doc/latex/base/source2e.pdf+ (module ltdirchk).
    Usually changes are not required for many TeX distributions
    such as Unix (web2c), MikTeX, ...
  * Formats need rebuilding (e.g., fmtutil).

Module psnfss
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  * The map files need further configuring (e.g., updmap).

Module graphics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  * Module graphics does not provide all driver files, because some are
    developed independently (+pdftex.def+, ...).

Design Principles
-----------------

* Compliance with the latest TDS specification.
* No redundancy.
* User friendly PDF files with navigational support:
  - bookmarks
  - links
* Complete documentation. The documentation generation with
  enhanced PDF files is the tricky part and should be saved
  from the user.
* Output format of generated documentation is PDF, see above.
  Other formats such as DVI or PS are not generated and provided.
* Documentation bundles are preferred to many partial documentation
  files (e.g. +source2e.pdf+ or +ltnews.pdf+).
* If several expansion stages of a documentation are available,
  then just the most complete expansion stage should be used.
* Files that do not fit in a program sub tree of TDS stay below
  +TDS:source+ (e.g. +latexbug.el+ from latex/base). Then they do not
  get lost at least.
* Page layout: +a4paper+ with reduced vertical margins (exception: ltnews).
  (This also decreases the page number usually.)
* ...


Remarks
-------

Base
~~~~
* +source2e.pdf+ is used instead of many single +lt*.pdf+ files.
* +ltnews.pdf+ is introduced to avoid cluttering the doc directory
  with many single sheet +ltnews*.pdf+ files.
* Patch for +ltfssdcl.dtx+: Checksum fixed.
* ...

Tools
~~~~~
* Added: +tools.pdf+ as overview/contents/index file with links
  and short descriptions of the single packages. (It uses
  the data from +manifest.txt+).
* ...

Knuth
~~~~~
* Current CTAN -> TDS mapping in use:
  +CTAN:systems/knuth/dist+ -> +TDS:<toplevel>/knuth+
* Unsure where to put trip/trap files. Currently they are
  put in +TDS:source+, because the documentation files
  (+tripman.pdf+, +trapman.pdf+) are in +TDS:doc+. They lists the
  trip/trap files already.
* Not covered is
  {ctan}systems/knuth/dist/lib/[CTAN:systems/knuth/dist/lib/]
  In TeX Live 2007/2008 the files are installed at different
  locations:

Build Hints
-----------

The most important advice I can give: `Forget it'!
The purpose of the source files are rather to show, what was
done in which way.
The +*.zip+ with TDS trees are the goal of the project, not the
build process. Some remarks, if someone wants to build the
modules himself:

* TeX compiler: LuaTeX and pdfTeX (&ge; 1.30).
* An up-to-date LaTeX installation, at least TeX Live 2012.
* Additional packages can be necessary, e.g.
  {ctan}language/armenian/armtex.zip[CTAN:language/armenian/armtex.zip]
  is not part of TeX Live 2012.
* Most of the PDF files are generated using lualatex and package
  `fontspec' that uses the Latin Modern fonts as default. They
  are available as OpenType fonts. LuaTeX generates with OpenType
  fonts considerably smaller PDF files. Also PDF object stream
  compression is used (PDF 1.5). Therefore the further
  post-processing of PDF files are currently dropped.
* (Outdated since 2011-07-01) PDF post-processing, I have used two steps:
+
--
  1. First step:
     a. I have written a tool that analyzes page stream contents and
        optimizes them (removal of unnecessary color settings, minimize
        translation operations, ...)
        -> +pdfbox-rewrite.jar+.
     b. For reading and writing the PDF file I have used PDFBox
        -> +PDFBox-0.7.2.jar+ (http://pdfbox.apache.org/).
     c. To get better results I patched some of the classes
        of PDFBox (especially the write module)
        -> +pdfbox-rewrite.jar+.
  2. The final conversion step was done by Multivalent, because
     it makes a very good job in PDF compression:
     -> +Multivalent20060102.jar+ (http://multivalent.sourceforge.net/)

Multivalent and PDFBox are available, +pdfbox-rewrite.jar+, however,
  is just a first prototype, not ripe for a release.
  Therefore this step of post-processing is optional for the
  project latex-tds. The build script looks for the library and
  skips this steps automatically if necessary.
    If you give the build script the option +--nopostprocess+,
  then it will skip the postprocess steps (building is faster,
  the pdf files a little larger).
    Install the jar files in the directory +lib+ where
  they are expected by the build script.
--
* Unix, Perl background is expected.
* No support or documentation.
