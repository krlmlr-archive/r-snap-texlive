-- ----------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you
--    received it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered
--    modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived
--    Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.
-- 3. You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a
--    complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2
--    above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that
--    the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly
--    as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work
--    directly from the Work.
