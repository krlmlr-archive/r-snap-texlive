The pdfpages Package
--------------------

This package simplifies the insertion of external multi-page PDF
documents into LaTeX documents. Pages can be freely selected and
similar to psnup it is possible to put several logical pages onto
each sheet of paper. Furthermore a lot of hypertext features like
hyperlinks and article threads are provided. This package supports
pdfTeX, VTeX, and XeTeX. With VTeX it is even possible to use
this package to insert PostScript files, in addition to PDF files.


INSTALLATION:

An easy way to install this package is to download the TDS-packaged
zip file form

   CTAN:install/macros/latex/contrib/pdfpages.tds.zip

and to unzip this file into your TeX-tree, e.g.:

   unzip -d /usr/local/TL2008/texmf-local/  pdfpages.tds.zip

That's all you have to do.


Only if you want to extract and install the files manually, proceed
as follows:

 * Run `latex pdfpages.ins' to produce the LaTeX files
 * Run `latex pdfpages.dtx' to produce the documentation
 * Move the files into appropriate directories searched by LaTeX.
