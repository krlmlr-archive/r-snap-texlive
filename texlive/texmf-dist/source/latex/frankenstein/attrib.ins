    This file may have one of TWO names, either
    attrib.sty or attrib.stq.  This
    LaTeX package will work ONLY if it is called attrib.sty
    and placed in a proper directory.  This file should have been
    distributed to you with a DIFFERENT file (also) called
    attrib.sty which functions identically to this one
    but contains documentation in comments.  This file works faster,
    but the other should be kept because it contains the documentation
    for this LaTeX package. Files called README and INSTALL should have
    also been distributed to you with this file; see them for more
    information.
