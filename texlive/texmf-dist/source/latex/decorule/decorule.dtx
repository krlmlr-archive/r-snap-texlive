% \begin{abstract}\noindent
% This package implements a decorative swelled rule using
% only a symbol from a font installed with all distributions of
% \TeX{}, so it works independently, without the need to install
% any additional software or fonts.\par
% This is the packaged version of the macro which was
% originally published in the `Typographers' Inn'
% column in TUGboat \cite{tb97}.\par
% This version fixes the bug caused by failing to supply the
% correct values for DVI drivers for rendering glyph rotation.
% The result now works in Postscript output but DVI viewers may
% still display incorrectly.\par

% \section{Swelled rules}
% Swelled rules were a popular device in 19th century
% typesetting, and were usually done as special sorts from a
% typefounder, or in some cases fabricated from combinations of
% decorative brass rule cut to calculated lengths.\par
% In digital systems, they can be implemented as images or
% as glyphs in fonts, but are not usually extensible except by
% distortion. This example is constructed programmatically so
% that it could be adapted to the width it is required for (that
% feature is not implemented in this version and is left as an
% exercise to the user).\par
% \subsection{Other work}
% As discussed in the original article \cite{tb97} there is an \textsf{swrule} package
%   by Tobias Dussa \cite{dussa} which builds a
%   geometric lozenge from very fine lines, and there is a paper
%   by Steve Peter \cite{peter} which describes
%   a more extensible method using \MP{} for
%   \ConTeXt{}.\par
% \subsection{This solution}
% However, it is also possible to produce one using just a
%   character from a font, combined with some looping in a macro
%   with careful positioning and kerning. This example was
%   constructed from the swung dash (\DescribeMacro{\sim}\verb`\sim`)
%   character in math mode, rotated and scaled to fit in an
%   asending and then descending series.\par
% This package is available from your nearest CTAN
%   respository in the directory \url{}. The original
%   example is available at
%   \url{http://latex.silmaril.ie/packages/decorule}.
%   All suggestions for improving and extending it are
%   welcome.\par

% \subsection{Bugs}
% Rainer adS and Herbert Schulz kindly pointed out on
%   \url{comp.text.tex}\footnote{%
% \url{<j0sco9$emv$1@news.albasani.net>} 
%       and
%       \url{<herbs-038AC9.15151428072011@news.wowway.com>}} that it failed when using standard (DVI)
%   \LaTeX{}, although it was correct when using
%   \emph{pdflatex}.\par
% Attempts to render the DVI with (eg)
%   \emph{dvipdf} were failing with a
%   Ghostscript error: \verb`/undefined in \c@sym@rotate`.\par
% Heiko Overdiek kindly identified the problem with the
%   \DescribeMacro{\c@sym@rotate}\verb`\c@sym@rotate` counter, that `it
%     isn't expandable. The graphics package only uses \texttt{edef}, but in the \texttt{special}, the explicit number is
%     needed, because PostScript or GhostScript don't know
%     \TeX{}.'\par
% The result now works in Postscript output but DVI
%   viewers may still display incorrectly.\par

% \section{Implementation}
% The package consists of a single main macro \texttt{decorule}, which cycles through sizes
% of the symbol from minimum to maximum, rotating and scaling
% according to values preset here; and then from the maximum
% back down to the minimum.\par
% \subsection{Preliminary declarations}
% \begin{macro}{\sym@min}
% Define a counter and a minimum point size to start and
%     end with. This value is an integer, hence a counter is
%     used.\par
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcounter{sym@min}
\setcounter{sym@min}{1}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\sym@max}
% Do the same for the maximum point size that the rule
%     will get to in the middle.\par
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcounter{sym@max}
\setcounter{sym@max}{20}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\sym@step}
% Set the step size or the increments of the glyph in
%     whole points.\par
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcounter{sym@step}
\setcounter{sym@step}{1}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\sym@rotate}
% Specify the amount in (whole) degrees by which we will
%     need to rotate the symbol to make each glyph mesh with the
%     previous one. The use of the
%     \DescribeMacro{\thesym@rotate}\verb`\thesym@rotate` form is a bugfix due to
%     Heiko Oberdiek in \url{news:comp.text.tex} at \textlangle\verb`j0sonk$q9v$1@dont-email.me`\textrangle{}.\par
% \changes{v0.6}{2011/08/02}{Added fix from Heiko for sym@rotate}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcounter{sym@rotate}
\renewcommand*{\thesym@rotate}{\the\c@sym@rotate}%
\setcounter{sym@rotate}{45}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\sym@size}
% Define a counter to hold the current (calculated) size
%     as we loop through the sizes.\par
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcounter{sym@size}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\sym@raise}
% Define a length to hold the amount calculated at each
%     step to raise/lower each glyph by (because we rotate them as
%     we go).\par
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newlength{\sym@raise}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\sym@skip}
% Define another length to hold the amount calculated to
%     backspace between successive glyphs to make sure they
%     touch.\par
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newlength{\sym@skip}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\sym@symbol}
% Lastly, define the font character to use as the glyph.
%     For the swelled rule we use the swung dash.\par
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand{\sym@symbol}{$\sim$}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \subsection{The main macro}
% \begin{macro}{\decorule}
% Now we can define the macro that does the actual
%     work.\par

% Raise, rotate, and (in this case of

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Activities other than distribution and/or modification
%   of the Work are not covered by this license; they are
%   outside its scope. In particular, the act of running the
%   Work is not restricted and no requirements are made
%   concerning any offers of support for the Work.
% \item \label{LPPL:item:distribute}You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the
%   Work as you received it.  Distribution of only part of the
%   Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to
%   distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed under the
%   terms of this clause.
% \item You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been
%   generated from a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as
%   distributed under Clause~\vref{LPPL:item:distribute} above, as
%   long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that
%   the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system
%   exactly as it would have been installed if they generated a
%   Compiled Work directly from the Work.
% \item \label{LPPL:item:currmaint}If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may,
%   without restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a
%   Derived Work.  You may also distribute the Derived Work
%   without restriction, including Compiled Works generated from
%   the Derived Work.  Derived Works distributed in this manner
%   by the Current Maintainer are considered to be updated
%   versions of the Work.
% \item If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you
%   may modify your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived
%   Work based on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus
%   creating a Compiled Work based on the Derived Work.
% \item \label{LPPL:item:conditions}If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you
%   may distribute a Derived Work provided the following
%   conditions are met for every component of the Work unless
%   that component clearly states in the copyright notice that
%   it is exempt from that condition.  Only the Current
%   Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption to
%   a component of the Work.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct
%       replacement for a component of the Work when that
%       component is used with the Base Interpreter, then,
%       wherever this component of the Work identifies itself to
%       the user when used interactively with that Base
%       Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived
%       Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a
%       modified version of this component to the user when used
%       interactively with that Base Interpreter.
% \item Every component of the Derived Work contains
%       prominent notices detailing the nature of the changes to
%       that component, or a prominent reference to another file
%       that is distributed as part of the Derived Work and that
%       contains a complete and accurate log of the
%       changes.
% \item No information in the Derived Work implies that any
%       persons, including (but not limited to) the authors of
%       the original version of the Work, provide any support,
%       including (but not limited to) the reporting and
%       handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work
%       unless those persons have stated explicitly that they do
%       provide such support for the Derived Work.
% \item You distribute at least one of the following with
%       the Derived Work:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your
%   distribution of a modified component is made by
%   offering access to copy the modified component from
%   a designated place, then offering equivalent access
%   to copy the Work from the same or some similar place
%   meets this condition, even though third parties are
%   not compelled to copy the Work along with the
%   modified component;
% \item Information that is sufficient to obtain a
%   complete, unmodified copy of the Work.
% \end{enumerate}
% \end{enumerate}
% \item If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you
%   may distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived
%   Work, as long as the Derived Work is distributed to all
%   recipients of the Compiled Work, and as long as the
%   conditions of Clause~\vref{LPPL:item:conditions}, above, are met
%   with regard to the Derived Work.
% \item The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and
%   hence do not apply to, the modification, by any method, of
%   any component so that it becomes identical to an updated
%   version of that component of the Work as it is distributed
%   by the Current Maintainer under Clause~\vref{LPPL:item:currmaint}, above.
% \item Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an
%   alternative format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in
%   whole or in part) is then produced by applying some process
%   to that format, does not relax or nullify any sections of
%   this license as they pertain to the results of applying that
%   process.
% \item % \begin{enumerate}
% \item A Derived Work may be distributed under a different
%       license provided that license itself honors the
%       conditions listed in Clause~\vref{LPPL:item:conditions} above, in
%       regard to the Work, though it does not have to honor the
%       rest of the conditions in this license.
% \item If a Derived Work is distributed under a different
%       license, that Derived Work must provide sufficient
%       documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient
%       of that Derived Work to honor the restrictions in
%       Clause~\vref{LPPL:item:conditions} above, concerning
%       changes from the Work.
% \end{enumerate}
% \item This license places no restrictions on works that are
%   unrelated to the Work, nor does this license place any
%   restrictions on aggregating such works with the Work by any
%   means.
% \item Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used
%   to, prevent complete compliance by all parties with all
%   applicable laws.
% \end{enumerate}
% \subsection{No Warranty}\label{LPPL:Warranty}
% There is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise
%       stated in writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work
%       `as is', without warranty of any kind, either
%       expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
%       warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
%       purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
%       the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you
%       assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or
%       correction.\par
% In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to
%       in writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the
%       components of the Work, or any other party who may distribute
%       and/or modify the Work as permitted above, be liable to you for
%       damages, including any general, special, incidental or
%       consequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out
%       of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited to,
%       loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses
%       sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to
%       operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder
%       or said author or said other party has been advised of the
%       possibility of such damages.\par
% \subsection{Maintenance of The Work}\label{LPPL:Maintenance}
% The Work has the status `author-maintained'
%       if the Copyright Holder explicitly and prominently states near
%       the primary copyright notice in the Work that the Work can only
%       be maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply that it is
%       `author-maintained'.\par
% The Work has the status `maintained' if there
%       is a Current Maintainer who has indicated in the Work that they
%       are willing to receive error reports for the Work (for example,
%       by supplying a valid e-mail address). It is not required for the
%       Current Maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error
%       reports.\par
% The Work changes from status `maintained' to
%       `unmaintained' if there is no Current Maintainer,
%       or the person stated to be Current Maintainer of the work cannot
%       be reached through the indicated means of communication for a
%       period of six months, and there are no other significant signs
%       of active maintenance.\par
% You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by
%       agreement with any existing Current Maintainer to take over this
%       role.\par
% If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current
%       Maintainer of the Work through the following steps:\par
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current
%   Maintainer (and the Copyright Holder, if the two differ)
%   through the means of an Internet or similar search.
% \item If this search is successful, then enquire whether the
%   Work is still maintained.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item If it is being maintained, then ask the Current
%       Maintainer to update their communication data within one
%       month.
% \item \label{LPPL:item:intention}If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume
%       active maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer,
%       then announce within the pertinent community your
%       intention to take over maintenance.  (If the Work is a
%       \LaTeX{} work, this could be done, for example, by
%       posting to \url{news:comp.text.tex}.)
% \end{enumerate}
% \item % \begin{enumerate}
% \item If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to
%       pass maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes
%       effect immediately upon announcement.
% \item \label{LPPL:item:announce}If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the
%       Copyright Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be
%       passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon
%       announcement.
% \end{enumerate}
% \item \label{LPPL:item:change}If you make an `intention announcement'
%   as described in~\vref{LPPL:item:intention} above and after three
%   months your intention is challenged neither by the Current
%   Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people,
%   then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to
%   name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.
% \item If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes
%   reachable once more within three months of a change
%   completed under the terms of~\vref{LPPL:item:announce}
%   or~\vref{LPPL:item:change}, then that
%   Current
%   Maintainer must become or remain the Current Maintainer upon
%   request provided they then update their communication data
%   within one month.
% \end{enumerate}
% A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself,
%       alter the fact that the Work is distributed under the
%       \textsc{lppl} license.\par
% If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should
%       immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and
%       unambiguous statement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You
%       should also announce your new status to the same pertinent
%       community as in~\vref{LPPL:item:intention}
%       above.\par
% \subsection{Whether and How to Distribute Works under This
%       License}\label{LPPL:Distribute}
% This section contains important instructions, examples, and
%       recommendations for authors who are considering distributing
%       their works under this license.  These authors are addressed as
%       `you' in this section.\par
% \subsubsection{Choosing This License or Another License}\label{LPPL:Choosing}
% If for any part of your work you want or need to use
% \emph{distribution} conditions that differ
% significantly from those in this license, then do not refer to
% this license anywhere in your work but, instead, distribute
% your work under a different license. You may use the text of
% this license as a model for your own license, but your license
% should not refer to the \textsc{lppl} or otherwise
% give the impression that your work is distributed under the
% \textsc{lppl}.\par
% The document \url{modguide.tex} in the base \LaTeX{}
% distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of
% this license.  It explains, for example, why distributing
% \LaTeX{} under the \textsc{gnu} General Public
% License (\textsc{gpl}) was considered inappropriate.
% Even if your work is unrelated to \LaTeX{}, the discussion in
% \url{modguide.tex} may still be
% relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works
% under any license are encouraged to read it.\par
% \subsubsection{A Recommendation on Modification Without
% Distribution}\label{LPPL:WithoutDistribution}
% It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even
% for your own personal use, without also meeting the above
% conditions for distributing the modified component.  While you
% might intend that such modifications will never be
% distributed, often this will happen by accident~--- you may
% forget that you have modified that component; or it may not
% occur to you when allowing others to access the modified
% version that you are thus distributing it and violating the
% conditions of this license in ways that could have legal
% implications and, worse, cause problems for the community. It
% is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy
% of the Work identical with the public one.  Many works provide
% ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any
% of its licensed components.\par
% \subsubsection{How to Use This License}\label{LPPL:HowTo}
% To use this license, place in each of the components of
% your work both an explicit copyright notice including your
% name and the year the work was authored and/or last
% substantially modified.  Include also a statement that the
% distribution and/or modification of that component is
% constrained by the conditions in this license.\par
% Here is an example of such a notice and statement:\par
% \begin{verbatim}
%%% pig.dtx
%%% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name
%%
%% This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
%% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3
%% of this license or (at your option) any later version.
%% The latest version of this license is in
%%   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
%% and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
%% version 2005/12/01 or later.
%%
%% This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.
%% 
%% The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.
%%
%% This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins
%% and the derived file pig.sty.
% \end{verbatim}
% Given such a notice and statement in a file, the
% conditions given in this license document would apply, with
% the `Work' referring to the three files
% \url{pig.dtx}, \url{pig.ins}, and \url{pig.sty} (the last being generated
% from \url{pig.dtx} using \url{pig.ins}), the `Base
%   Interpreter' referring to any
% `\LaTeX{}-Format', and both `Copyright
%   Holder' and `Current Maintainer'
% referring to the person
% M.~Y.~Name\index{M.~Y.~Name}.\par
% If you do not want the Maintenance section of
% \textsc{lppl} to apply to your Work, change
% `maintained' above into
% `author-maintained'. However, we recommend that
% you use `maintained' as the Maintenance
% section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains
% useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain
% and support it yourself.\par
% \subsubsection{Derived Works That Are Not Replacements}\label{LPPL:NotReplacements}
% Several clauses of the \textsc{lppl} specify
% means to provide reliability and stability for the user
% community. They therefore concern themselves with the case
% that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a (compatible or
% incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If this is not
% the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a
% completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not
% apply.\par
% \subsubsection{Important Recommendations}\label{LPPL:Recommendations}
% \paragraph{Defining What Constitutes the Work}
% The \textsc{lppl} requires that distributions
%   of the Work contain all the files of the Work.  It is
%   therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee
%   to determine which files constitute the Work.  This could,
%   for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files
%   of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by
%   using a line such as:\par
% \begin{verbatim}
%% This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.
% \end{verbatim}
% in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it
%   might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is
%   considered by you to comprise the Work and, in such a case,
%   the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable
%   conjectures as to which files comprise the Work.\par
