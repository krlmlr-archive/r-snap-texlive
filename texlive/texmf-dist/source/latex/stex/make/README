This directory contains two Makefiles for inclusion into Makefile-based build systems. 

file                        contains
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Makefile.base.vars          general variable declarations (include before all others)
Makefile.base.in            general rules (include before all others)
Makefile.latexml.vars       variable declarations for the LaTeXML conversion
Makefile.latexml.in         rules for producing OMDoc via LaTeXML
Makefile.latex.vars         variable declarations for LaTeX formatting
Makefile.latex.in           rules for LaTeX formatting
Makefile.vars               combines all *.vars above
Makefile.in                 combines all *.in above

The usual setup for this will be to create SVN externals 
- the deployed instance of sTeX (i.e. https://svn.kwarc.info/repos/sTeX/trunk or /latest)
- to this directory
and use the lines

STEXDIR = <the sTeX external>
include $(STEXDIR)/make/Makefile.vars
include $(STEXDIR)/make/Makefile.in

at appropriate places in the calling Makefile. It is crucial to set STEXDIR variable to make this setup work.
