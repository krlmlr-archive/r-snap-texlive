Package gridset

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package provides commands to save positions to and restore positions
from aux-file.  This may be used for grid setting (aka strict in-register
setting).  The package needs pdfTeX at least version 1.40.

If you have a distribution of gridset with an archive containing the files

   doc/
   doc/latex/gridset
   doc/latex/gridset/gridset.pdf
   source/
   source/latex/
   source/latex/gridset/
   source/latex/gridset/gridset.dtx
   source/latex/gridset/README
   tex/
   tex/latex/
   tex/latex/gridset
   tex/latex/gridset/gridset.sty
   tex/latex/gridset/gridsetexample.tex

you may simply extract this archive at your local texmf tree (local TDS tree)
that may be e.g. C:\localtexmf or /usr/local/share/texmf or
/usr/TeX/texmf-local.  On some systems you may ask for the local TDS tree
using: `kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFLOCAL'. After extraction you should update
your File Name DataBase e.g. using the MiKTeX Options dialog or texhash.

If the files are at a root directory gridset the distributor has changed my
original distribution archive and you have to copy the files yourself into
the appropriate directories at one of your texmf trees and update your File
Name DataBase.

If you instead of this have only the files gridset.dtx, README, and
gridset.pdf (optional), you have to call:
   tex gridset.dtx
and follow the instructions.

Notes: 
- If you only want to test gridset without installation, you may simply use
  a copy of gridset.dtx renamed to gridset.sty.
- README is not a user documentation file, but only needed until 
  installation has been done.  Because of this, I declare it to be a 
  source file.  Nevertheless distrbutors may install it as an additional 
  documentation file.
